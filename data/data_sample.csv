10,https://www.gofundme.com/f/abandoned-rescue-pup-needs-surgery,Abandoned Rescue Pup Needs Mouth Surgery,"Hi everyone! This is Ace (or Space Ace, Acey Pacey, etc.). Ace has an oronasal fistula which usually results from dental disease when the teeth decay it can create a hole. The hole leads to his airways meaning food and water can get into his airways and cause infection or pneumonia. He is about 10 years old and has no teeth nor a lower jaw. Poor baby also has arthritis and cataracts. We rescued him about  a month ago.  We inquired about adopting Ace for my boyfriend's mom about a year ago at first. He was at first picked up at the Vallejo SPCA (I think his first owner died). We filled an application out, but by the time we did they said someone had adopted him. Well flash forward a year later, now, I saw them post him on their Instagram and immediately emailed them to see if it was a mistake that he was back for adoption. They told me he was back at the shelter and the people who adopted him just abandoned him at the rescue in the little play area they have outside -- no formal abandonment. Just left this sweetheart outside for them to discover him and figure out who this dog was that wasn't tagged like the rest of the dogs at the rescue. The rescue determined that they probably abandoned him because of medical reasons. We then decided to adopt him. We adopted him at a shelter in San Francisco who raised a GoFundMe of ~$600 to get this surgery done for him (closing the oronasal fistula) from a vet who was giving them a huge discount b/c of their rescue status. When the day of the surgery came, they said the vet decided it was too dangerous to do the surgery based on his size (5 lbs) and his age. So we adopted him as they told us it wasn't fixable, but this baby needed a home so we were fine with it and have been pre-cautious on keeping him warm at all times and by making his food very special. He is a very happy pup now in his new home with his new sister, Chula. He is very loved now, but everyday you can hear this poor baby sniffling or hacking because water or something has gotten up there. It is very scary. So, we decided to get consultations/second-opinions from other vets and the 3 vets we seen all said it was more than possible to help him out and they were very confused to why the other vet said no all-of-a-sudden. Considering the rescue had a goal of only ~$500 for the surgery, thus, we were assuming it would be no more than $1,000 for such a tiny dog when we went to go get him checked out. The surgery quotes we got were from $3,000-$6,000 which includes the entire surgery procedure and a pre-op of x-rays and heart monitoring to see if he's medically ok to proceed, not just based on his age and size but his actual vitals. We really want to help our new family member. We adopted him accepting full responsibility for his medical issues, but thought the fistula really couldn't be fixed. The rescue disclosed this info to us and we were okay with giving him a new home in this condition and wanted to help take care of it. However, now that we know it can be fixed, we want to help him in any way possible. We have only had him for about a month and so it was very sudden to learn about the $3,000-$6,000 surgery. Anything helps, if you can and we are all so grateful if you can. I am currently talking to the vet who offered $3,000 to schedule the surgery, but don't want to schedule if I cannot afford so I thought I'd give this GoFundMe a shot. Ace would really appreciate it. He has been through so much and deserves all the love and care in the world.

They said they had won the lottery but being illegal they couldn't cash in, could she help them.  My mom went to a store with them but then they took her in their car and drove her from Hesperia, 80 miles to Los Angeles. She believes they had a gun. They took her to her bank and made her withdraw all her money, about $6000. After taking it they abandoned her there. She withdrew her last $8 and took the bus to my sister's house in Pico Rivera about 12 miles from where she was abandoned. Praise God my mom was unharmed but all her savings are gone and her bills unpaid! She was so traumatised by this event that she didn't say anything about it for a few days. Police say there is no chance of recovering her money. If you could find it in your heart to help make my mom whole again any amount would help.

12,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-shayna-become-a-childbirth-educator,Help Shayna Become a Childbirth Educator,"As many of you know, I took training to become a birth doula near the end of 2017. It was my first step into birth work and the related fields that had piqued my interest, and I was incredibly inspired by what I learned and saw. But soon after the training ended, I realized that attending births wouldn’t work as long as I was in my full time job – I can’t exactly drop what I’m doing and leave when I’m called, as much as I would like to! So I continued to explore options, partly to see what would allow me to be a birth doula and partly to see what else was out there. I continued to research, asked what other doulas did, and read as much as I could for ideas on what else I may enjoy doing, either alongside or outside of being a birth doula. Leaving aside the many other things I’ve been working on, one option that immediately stood out to me was childbirth education (also known as CBE). While being a doula and educating people as a childbirth educator are two vastly different things, they both have an important place within reproductive justice work. If I can’t be right there with someone during their birth, I could at least help them get the tools and information they needed to feel prepared for the rest of their pregnancy, labor, birth, and beyond. I had never I would want to teach, but I’ve realized more and more how incredibly fun and rewarding it can be. And best of all, it’s possible to teach outside of typical work hours, such as on weekends with two-day intensives or over the course of a couple of weeks or so with night classes. The flexibility would allow me to start doing this without having to quit my current job before I’m financially ready to do so. A win-win! Last year, I started looking into organizations that trained educators, of which there are many. Technically anyone can teach CBE, as (much like with doulas) it isn’t a regulated field, but I wanted to have a solid foundation before starting. As much as I know I could read and learn a lot on my own, having another person formally teaching me information is my preferred method of learning and feeling prepared (which is also why I want to teach!). I originally had found an organization that looked promising, but after taking advantage of a deal on their course, I realized later that it wasn’t for me for a variety of reasons. Being out the money (just under $300, down the drain) and realizing that not just any organization would suit my needs, I started to worry things would never come together. But then, thanks to numerous recommendations, I finally took a closer look at Doula Trainings International (DTI) – and I loved what I saw. Despite their name, DTI does more than just doula trainings – such as CBE. And completely in line with my values, they are social justice oriented in all they do. They include in their promise that they want the people they train to be human rights advocates and community builders, among other things. They recognize the way things that like race, gender, and class play a role in the barriers people face, especially when accessing reproductive care. They offer scholarships specifically for trans doulas and doulas of color. Their mission statement highlights reproductive justice. They are everything I could ask for from an organization! There’s only one problem: while their CBE training is online, it includes live sessions, which means it has set dates. With the next one fast approaching (it starts September 17th, so just over three months away!), I need to be able to afford it before September to secure my place and be ready to go. This is a semester long course – taking place over 15 weeks – and costs $997, not including the card processing fee and the $55 DTI membership needed to enroll. It is intensive, highly structured, challenging, and so incredibly worth it. Not only does it align to my values (and those underlying my WIP business), it doesn’t force a curriculum on teachers. Instead, they provide everything someone would need to create a course out-of-the-box, but they also give educators the freedom to make their own material if they choose to. They are not just training you how to teach THEIR way, they are giving you the knowledge and tools to create your own course to meet your community’s needs. How amazing is that? That means I could center those whose needs are often forgotten or ignored, both generally and in our community. I could demonstrate gender-inclusive teaching. I could show everyone what education free of biased, inaccurate, fatphobic BS looks like. I could bring to the area something I for one haven’t seen yet – and think we absolutely need. I’m hoping I can save enough money to enroll, but I also know it can be tough to save money in such a short amount of time, especially with how many bills I have. That isn’t to say it is completely impossible – I’m firmly lower-middle class at this point – but it certainly isn’t easy either especially when previous emergency vet bills drained much of what little savings I have. So with no pressure and no expectations, I wanted to create this GoFundMe for anyone that wanted to help ease the burden. This isn’t an emergency, and it isn’t something I can’t live without. Worst case, I could wait until the following Spring and hope they have another class then. But I’m really, really ready to start now, and your support would help me ensure I can get there that much sooner. If you think I could help the community, if you think I could help YOU in the future, if you want to see more (and more inclusive) CBE offerings in Sheboygan, if you think this dream is wild but want to see me succeed, if you think I could do some good – please consider donating. Even the smallest amounts help to offset costs so that I can keep working on my business and putting money (and time) into the other areas I’m working on. It’s okay if you don’t can’t or don’t want to donate. It’s okay if you don’t think I need the money or don’t have anything to give or just plain old don’t wanna. I’m not expecting anything! But I have learned from a few people lately that it isn’t wrong to ask for help, and we don’t always have to ask for help only when we are our wit’s end. And in this case, I have to keep reminding myself – this isn’t just for me. This is an investment into something for our community, and I need to remember to VALUE the work I want to do. It is important, it is valuable, and it is a worthy goal to be able to provide it. With your help, I’m hoping to do that as soon as possible. Thank you for your reading and for your interest!

Njoroge is a Husband to Florence Njoroge and a father to 3 adorable children (aged 17, 14 & 6 - two adorable girls and a son)   aka Lou Gehrig’s disease. ALS is an auto immune disease that weakens muscles and impacts physical function.  Throughout his diagnosis, Njoroge did not slow down in running his law firm. He worked hard and diligently to help and assist those in need of his expertise. You would hardly tell that he was battling ALS as his passion for work distracted him from thinking about this irreversible diagnosis.   Njoroge and his family researched the treatment options and have tried many therapies. The first break was in Mexico where they offer bone marrow cell treatments and the great success they have had with patients afflicted with ALS.  The average annual expenses for Njoroge’s treatment thus far in the last 8 years has been around $90,000 donated by family members. This cost includes treatment in Mexico for the bone marrow cell treatment every 3 months and this has been his saving grace. We can say with confidence that this treatment has helped him improve and slow down the progression of the debilitating ALS disease.  In March of 2019, Njoroge got a pneumonia attack leaving him very weak to return to work. He is however recovering very well with his wife as a primary caretaker.

While the season was fun and overall successful for the players, we did have one of our players, Bryan,  suffer a major knee injury.  This injury required immediate surgery at Johns Hopkins and will require months of rehab and physical therapy for Bryan.  This, along with needing other special accommodations, will put a heavy financial burden on the family.

17,https://www.gofundme.com/f/binkley-family,The Binkley Family,"Hello, I am Diana Binkley, my husband, Mark, and I are reaching out to ask for help to improve the quality of life for our two daughters, Arianna who is 21 and Katarina who is 25. Both of our daughters have medical issues that challeges them daily. Our family lives in St. Inigoes, in southern MD, a very rural area. There is no public transportation that comes to our neighborhood, and it is very difficult to have cell coverage and internet access is very limited, you must have cable (which we do not have) to have  internet services.  It is necessary for Mark and I to work two jobs each to just make ends meet. Mark works 12 - 16 hours a day Monday - Friday, and 8 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday. During the school year I work 8 -12 hours a day Monday - Friday and 5 plus hours on Saturday and Sunday.  To increase our challenges, at most times we only have one vehicle. Many days Mark and I leave the house around 5:30 a.m. and do not return until after 10:00 p.m. or later. This results in Katarina and Arianna staying home sometimes for weeks at a time, unless they have a doctor's appointment, in which Mark or myself must take off work to take them to.  Our goal is to be able to get another vehicle for our family that is reliable and able to transport Katarina's power wheelchair. We have also determined that we need to move to a home that is handicap accessable. Katarina has limited mobility, she falls frquently and is now at a point in her life where most days she needs the use of her wheelchair, however the home that we rent at this time is not handicap accessable from the outside to get into the home, and once Katarina is inside of the home she is unable to use her wheelchair, forcing her to attempt to walk utilizing her walker which is not ideal for the layout of our home either.  Even with use of her walker, at times she still falls, and many times these fall’s result in injuries, requiring a visit to the ER. With this move we want to insure that the entrance to the home is handicap accessible, as well as the layout of the inside of the home itself.  We also need to insure that there is internet access, so Arianna can continue her college classes online and so Katarina can complete her career program. We also need to move to an area that Katarina has access to public transportation to give her the independence she deserves.  The following will explain to you what medical issues each Arianna and Katarina deal with daily and why it is necessary for both of them to still remain at home with Mark and myself. All funds that are collected will be used to improve their quality of life and give them the opportunity to live independent lives. When Arianna was 13 she came down with with micro-plasma pneumonia. She was ill from October 2011 until March 2012. The residual effects of her pneumonia has now left her with asthma. Since the pneumonia she has also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I.B.S., P.O.T.S. (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardic Syndrome), Syncope and Severe Aniety Disorder. Due to Arianna's medical condition's she was unable to attend school for close to half of her senior year. In addition due to her health issues, Arianna was unable to go off to college and take advantage of her academic, athletic, and music scholarships. Unfortionatly due to financial issues Arianna has not been able to obtain her drivers license. This limits her independence also as well as the fact that at this time our family is down to one vehicle.  Katarina born with Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus. Spina Bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord do not form properly. Spina Bifida falls under the broader category of neural tube  defects. Hydrocephalus is excess of spinal fluid in the brain. Katarina has undergone over 100 surgeries since she was one day old. The sugeries have been from closing the opening of her spine, placing and replacing multiple shunts for the hydrocephalus, augmentation of bowel, augmentation to the bladder and multiple revisions, tendon and ligament lengthening, and surgery for a Chiari Malformation where the doctors had to remove a portion of the skull. Katarina also has a seizure disorder. Katarina has ongoing medical conditions, one that she focuses on daily is chronic pain. Due to Spina Bifida Katarina's mobility has always been challenging for her. Katarina is only able to walk short distances, and even then the risk of her falling is very high. As Katarina ages her mobility is decreasing. There are times when Katarina has needed the use of her wheelchair in our home, however our home is not handicap accessable. Due to unfortunate circumstances our family no longer has a vehicle to transport Katarina's wheelchair at this time. From 2007 - 2013 our family lived in KS, where Katarina recieved medical care at Kansas City Children's Hospital. In 2012 Katarina aged out of the Children's Hospital. Katarina's medical condition is so unusual and complicated, we were unable to find a Neurosurgeon that would accept Katarina as a patient. Our primary care physician knew that we ad family in Southern MD, he recomended that Katarina seek medical care at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. We did our research and determined that it was in Katarina's best interest that we moved to MD.   Our family has has a very strong faith in God and we do believe he has always guided our family to have Katarina where she needed to be at all times.  We had only lived in MD for less then one month when Katarina had to have emergency surgery on her back.  With out this surgery Katarina would have lost all use of her lower body from mid waist down.  Only a couple of months later it was necessary for Katarina to have yet another emergency surgery for her Chiari Malformation.  If it was not for Dr. Weingart, and his staff at Johns Hopkins Katarina most probably would not still be with us. The only negative thing of the move From Kansas to Southern Maryland has been the difference in the cost of living between the two states.  While in KS our family did not face financial challenges.  At that time we were able to reach out an assist others.   As we have stated previously, all donations will be used to improve the quality of life for both Katarina and Arianna. Thank you for your time, consideration, and generosity, and for sharing our story.

She is in great need of a liver transplant and has rare O- blood type. Caroline is only 53 years old and is facing many challenges to live. Currently, she is on oxygen, it's very difficult for her to make it to many family events. Her daughter is 15 years old and Caroline has missed school functions due to not being able to be as mobile as she needs.  It's necessary for her to travel from her home on Long Island into NYC to New York- Presbyterian/ Weill Cornell Medical Center to see specialists and for procedures while on oxygen.  She worries she will run out of oxygen all the time. Often  traffic to and from NYC makes the trips duration different each time and very unpredictable for  someone on oxygen this can be very scary and potentially life threatening. Caroline's husband not only takes excellent care of her, he works full time, takes care of their daughter along with everyday things around the house. If he knows she has an adequate supply of oxygen it would help him tremendously.

The past couple years of my life have been filled with singing on my bike, in the streets, and in community song circles. I have written handfuls of songs, and I dream of sharing these in recorded form. I need your help to make this dream come true! This spring, I'm planning to record a 5-song EP. Recording these songs will allow me to share my songs more widely and will give others online access to these songs for learning and teaching.  Ultimately, this will help me to fulfill what feels to be a part of my highest purpose in these challenging times: To sing songs for the healing of earth.  Thank you for helping make this vision come to life through your financial support, sharing this with your friends, or at least by reading this far! ;)  Thank you, thank you, thank you and I hope that the songs that come of this project can bless you, too.

In elementary and high school, I sang in church choirs and in musical theater performances. In college, I sang in a music group and wrote songs in the echoey stairwells of my dorm.   More recently, my life has been filled with a midwestern song & bike tour (""Harvest in the Heartland: A Healing Song Bikeabout""), singing on stilts with the Carnival de Resistance in Philadelphia, and singing for justice movements and in community song circles in the Bay Area.  I currently live on Ramaytush Ohlone land and am an organizer of the Thrive Street Choir, the Assistant Director of the Music as Medicine Project, and a songleader at herchurch. ------ For more info about... -Current songs online:  -Music As Medicine Project:  -Thrive Street Choir:  -Healing Song Bikeabout: ",1553583600,2000,13,0,https://images.gofundme.com/4nrY7wyHuV19OIghRES_eqKwlQs=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37641154_1553812468694519_r.jpeg,,2020,a woman sitting on top of a wooden bench .,nan,

Woof n Wags Shelter, Lebanon received a notification from the Municipality to evict within a week and we do not have the means or finances to move out nor can we afford to get in trouble with the law. ￼ We are sheltering senior dogs, puppies, mama dogs with their litter, pregnant dogs, paralyzed dogs, blind dogs, sick dogs, 3-legged dogs, dogs recovering from abuse, and it is unthinkable and certainly unforgivable that any of them should end up back on the streets after they have experienced love and security. They will end up being run-over, shot, poisoned, chained, baits, electrocuted and for the lucky ones who escape human abuse, will starve.  This is the destiny that awaits our beautiful dogs if no help comes through. ￼ We are a very small team of two people who drive across the country from north to south and east to west rescuing dogs in need. We never rejected a call for help and our shelter gates were open for every rescuer who needed our help to keep their dogs safe. We haven't charged boarding facilities as our primary focus is to rescue and not to make a living out of our beloved fury friends. Now, we are asking for your help in return. ￼ Our team has exhausted every effort, our cars, our finances, our time, our energy and most importantly our emotions into rescuing and now that we need help we have not received it to this day. We need 20,000USD to rent a piece of barren land and convert it to a safe haven for our dogs. The expenses don't end there. We need to pay for transportation, fencing the area, building homes for the dogs, water and electricity, medication and treatment and food for 130 dogs.  ￼ Love creates miracles and we believe in miracles. Please consider skipping a night out to donate the amount to saving a dog's life. As you believed in us one day and came to us for help, we also believe in you now that we need your help. Despite the fears we are experiencing at the thought of losing our dogs, we remain hopeful and we pray that you would give us a helping hand. We are out of time.

Many of these students also travel from the rural areas of Nepal and stay on-site during the school year.  The school for many years, has made a mission of finding children from the remote areas of the country and providing them education for a subsidized and many times free-of-charge private education and boarding. For many children, the school's values of educating as many children despite their social class, has been a huge asset to their development and education.  We at The Next Purpose have partnered with the school to bring new outlooks, knowledge and experiences to the students in the forms of useful vocational skills, introductions to technical concepts as well as assisting in day to day classroom instruction. Volunteers travel from the U.S. to help the organization raise awareness of the program, participate in meaningful dialogue, assist with daily school programs as well as learn about the culture and customs of this great nation.  In the past, funds were raised to help refurbish an existing computer lab with newer, up-to-date computer models for the 350+ students attending the school.

THURSDAY January 31st TWO DAYS LATER she called and we received the news it was the C word... Cancer. Our son has cancer. Possibly Lymphoblastic Lymphoma or Leukemia. Which Lymphoma and Leukemia were both being thrown around so we were pretty confused. FRIDAY February 1st, both his Pediatrician and ENT Dr called and told us to go to the ER to be admitted for more testing not to wait on the Cancer Dr. Friday evening after more testing He was Officially Diagnosed with CANCER.

Unfortunately im left with no vehicle, the boys car seats are ruined along with everything else that was in the car. I Was on the way to get some medicine for rand due to a high fever, driving next to a creek the water began to overflow onto the road. It happened so quickly the road went from drivable to about 3 feet of water in a matter of seconds their was nothing that could've been done. The car stalled, I lost all power, the windows wouldn't go down and I was nearly unable to get the door open to get out. I had no choice but to try to get out and to dry land befor I was trapped in the car with the water rising quickly. By the time I got out and started to try to get to safety the water was hip deep. The area the car was in was completely under water and pushed it around 200 yards from where it was originally, cracked the windshield and caked the whole interior with mud due to being underwater as well as ruining everything under the hood. Its a huge loss but thankfully its just a car and it could've ended much worse. Luckily im ok and the boys weren't in the car. I've never been the kind of person that likes to ask for help but sadly this is a situation that im not sure what else to do. Any help I receive I am beyond thankful for.

33,https://www.gofundme.com/f/y3yxg6-brady039s-battle,Brady's Battle,"Tuesday, February 5th started out like any other morning. Shane and Brady were on their way to Brady's school when Shane was rear ended. The impact was strong enough to deploy the airbags and Shane was temporarily knocked unconscious. After climbing out of the passenger side door, Shane saw that Brady was pinned in the backseat. The impact had been so great that the back of the car had folded into itself. Brady was unconscious and needed to be extricated from the vehicle.  Shane was banged up and needed several staples to his head. Brady was much, much worse. After undergoing emergency surgery to relieve the swelling in his brain, Brady was put in a medically induced coma to allow his body to rest. He has a broken femur, broken mandible, facial fractures, and pneumonia from aspirating a significant amount of blood.  As I write this, Brady is still fighting for his future in the Intensive Care Unit. Once the swelling in his brain is minimized, he will need to have another surgery on his leg, as well as his facial fractures.  Doctors are cautiously optimistic about his recovery but stress that it will be a long road ahead.  Shane, Jennie, and Jakob are keeping vigil at Brady's bedside. They are not sure when they will be returning to work. They are not sure what types of rehabilitation Brady will need after his future surgeries. They are not sure how they are going to pay for all of these medical expenses.  That's where you come in! Brady is so loved by many and the Swenson family needs your support. We are asking for your help in any of the following ways: 1. Donate to this campaign. The money raised will help pay the costs of Brady's mounting medical bills, as well as provide for the family's living expenses so Shane and Jennie can focus on Brady instead of worrying about finances.  2. Pray. Spiritual support is so important in this time of great need. God is good and hears our prayers for a safe and consistent recovery for Brady.  3. Share this campaign on your social media accounts and with your contacts. The most successful campaigns are the ones that are seen, so please take a moment to share Brady's story.  This has been absolutely devastating to Brady's family. The worst part is that it was completely avoidable- Shane was not rear ended due to icy road conditions or faulty driving.

39,https://www.gofundme.com/f/healthadvocacyinGhana,Health Advocacy in Ghana,"Hello Everyone, My name is Linda A. Dufie. I am a Seventh-day Adventist, pursuing studies in pharmacy. I recently accepted an opportunity to volunteer through ASN Mission Driven Purpose (MDP), a nonprofit organization established in the Ghanaian Seventh-day Adventist community by the Twumasi Family in 2009. This organization provides outreach programs in Ghana and parts of Africa annually to raise new churches, promote health literacy and  to provide other humanitarian work, such as food  and clothing distribution. This year, the volunteerism will be held on December 14-28th. For more information on the organization, please feel free to visit  www.missiondrivenpurpose.com  and  Just some background information about myself: In the next 4 years, there are three things I hope to achieve. I hope to reinforce my commitment to community service; to excel in my academics, laying the foundation to become a competitive applicant for residency programs; and to gain more insights on my role as a pharmacy intern through various pharmacy careers. My ultimate goal is to establish a nonprofit organization in my motherland, Ghana. I was fortunate enough to have a first-hand experience with the limited access of healthcare in Ghana. Prior to my matriculation into pharmacy school , I worked as a nursing assistant for about 4 years and also had a year of pharmacy retail experience through Walmart and CVS. The combination of the rigorous nature of a retail setting and the provision of learning humility through a holistic approach at a nursing home has inspired me to pursue a career in geriatric pharmacy. I strongly believe that a career in geriatric pharmacy will give me a platform to be the functioning arms of disabled residents and the voice of my patients who cannot advocate for themselves. Despite my desire to promote health advocacy in Ghana,  I have not returned to my homeland for about 12 years now. By partaking in this program, I hope to build a rapport with the locals and to provide health screenings and literacy. I hope to also learn the process of growing and sustaining a non-profit organization overseas. I am worthy of receiving your donation for one reason. .

I met Brad 5 years ago when we worked a wedding together in South Carolina, and since then, I have continued to refer him to all of my clients based on his kind heart, calming spirit and amazing talent behind the lens. He’s a good guy. When I recently heard of Brad's diagnosis, I reached out to his wife, Lyndsey, to see if they needed any help outside of love and prayers to soften the financial burden that cancer treatment can bear. With her approval, here we are. Lyndsey has provided a more detailed background below! Thank you for any and every bit of help you can spare! In January 2017, Brad was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer. After having surgery to remove the tumor Brad was put on active surveillance (CT scans and blood work). He was in the clear until the fall of 2018 when his doctors noticed several enlarged lymph nodes growing on his aorta and IVC, which required him to need immediate surgery at UVA to remove all of the the lymph nodes in his retroperitoneal/stomach area. He came out of an 8 hour RPLND surgery and a week later learned several of those lymph nodes came back malignant. His doctors now consider the disease at a stage II. The next step was for Brad to have two cycles of chemotherapy to knock out any remaining cancer cells  in his body. Brad is finishing up his first cycle this week, and will start the second chemo cycle at the end of the month. He will need ct scans and blood work for the next 5 years, which is protocol for this type of cancer.

Toward that end, I have set a goal to attend the 2019 World Forum on Early Care and Education. Which will be held in Macao, China from April 8 – 11, 2019.  The    will bring together 800 early childhood educators and advocates from over 90 countries to share ideas and innovations in educating the world’s children.  As a delegate I will not just gain inspiration and knowledge but practical ideas and solutions to enhance my work with children and families. Delegates are asked to raise their own funds to pay for their attendance at the event.  Therefore, I am contacting you and your family. I am only reaching out to people who know me and who I believe understand and support my work around child development as a childhood educator, disability support worker and my work with children as a volunteer Scout Leader. So please let me know before sharing my appeal, as I would like to keep it away from any conflict of interest. I am hopeful that you will be able to support me, I will need to raise US$3,000 (AUS$4,500) in order to have enough money to pay for flights, accommodation and the Forum attendance, reassuring you that as always I look forward to support you when an opportunity arise. Any support you could give is gratefully appreciated. Thank you for your support, on behalf of the children I serve, the next generation of global citizens.

This school is sponsored by Child Hope and provides education and hope for kids in need.  Friends of Child Hope have paid to add a third floor to this school so that more students can experience a quality education.  The Focus Church Missions Team will spend a week on their Spring Break giving a fresh coat of paint to the entire school, building desks for the new classrooms and installing a computer lab. For every $10 donated for this cause, a heart will be hung on the stage wall at Focus Church, showing who ""Has a Heart"" for the mission.  We believe that in the next several weeks, our stage walls will be overflowing with hearts!  You are not limited to donating just $10 but ask that you consider giving in $10 increments.  Every dollar donated will be disbursed equally among the Focus Church Missions Team to help pay their airline, lodging and food for the trip.  We are trying to raise enough money by our deadline of March 24, 2019.  This is one of several fundraisers that the team is doing and each person is responsible for paying the difference in their account by the deadline.  The cost per person for this trip is $1200.   We are also accepting in person donations at Focus Church as well as checks through the mail.  Make your check payable to Focus Church and mail to Focus Church 411 N Thompson Road  Sun Prairie WI 53590.

It emerged from the passion to travel, and to enjoy every kilometer of the road, every landscape, every friend, every molecule that could be enjoyed in their adventures The Brazilian Kombi, model 1970 Type 2 passenger was created by Beto, a friend that everyone should have the need to know, born in the Osorio Family, a perfect mix between love, hospitality and good people. The prototype dream of a Latin Family, well Colombian! If you know Colombia, you will know what we are referring to, and if you don’t know, well you should do so urgently. Celia traveled through Colombia, participated in parades and filled many people with good memories, smiles and joy.  To walk with her was to see a crowd turn around to see her beauty. She always shined, with her own light ... that same light that Beto has.  Her last trip was perhaps the best she has ever done ... with the combination of 3 Argentine friends who adopted a Colombian (Taco Bell, born in Colombia but adopted by Canada 20 years ago) the perfect team would travel to Salento, Valle de Cocora and the coffee route. Celia would know Guaro guaro guaro, Calderon arsenal player and Gilbert ... It would have more laughter than any kombi, it would endure heat, too much food and a lot of trout.  Everything was a dream, it could not be measured. The team was perfect, the context even more. Back in Medellin, Celia was tired and set fire, it was pure hell. Beto desperate did everything possible but the attempts to put out the fire was not enough .. Nothing could be done. Celia burned and everything was lost in her, but we want her to be like the fenix and revive from the ashes We want to put it together again, with passion, love and patience. Something we had to learn perhaps is that friendship can do anything, that when you find people who vibrate with your same energy nothing can go wrong. That is why we need you, your help.

He had a spirit about him that resonated with just about everyone he met. His love for life, family and friends was undeniable. When Wilson was diagnosed with Brain Cancer in 2014, he didn’t crumble in the slightest; he fought and he fought hard. His ability to stay positive and encourage others throughout his battle with cancer was unremarkable. Wilson became very passionate about his journey, learning as much as he could about his diagnosis. Over the years he supported the cancer research and strived to reach out to other that were fighting, in an effort to give them hope and help them survive. Wilson’s fight to find a cure will continue to go on as his last request was to donate his brain to science, in hopes to help find a cure.  At 5:20 pm on February 6, 2019 Wilson Obrero passed away as a Father, husband, son, brother, cousin and friend to so many. He was surrounded by his top 3 people and they all held him and sang to him as he met Jesus.  He was the strongest person we had ever met. He never took for granted a single moment that he had on this earth. He loved his son more than ever and fought even harder during his battle to survive for him.

Anticipation and excitement filled the air, too, for Mama Gizzi, master pasta maker and co-owner (with hubby John Storch) of Mama Gizzi’s Gourmet Pasta, a popular Italian food retailer and wholesaler in Lake Worth, a quiet, south Florida city, as she prepared Christmas orders for her top area restaurants and hotels.      Big-hearted Mama, or Leah as her family knows her, was busy in her kitchen when her hand and arm accidentally got caught in the rapidly-spinning hopper of her pasta extruder.  Both her hand and arm were severely punctured and smashed.  On arrival at the emergency room, surgeons initially thought Leah’s hand would have to be amputated.      On removing the paddle which were still stuck in her, surgeons discovered that Leah’s hand was totally mangled with tendons and muscles damaged and that both forearm bones and her wrist were shattered.  The encouraging but of news was surgeons now felt confident they could save Leah’s hand, wrist and arm       So extensive was the damage and shock that surgery finally occurred 15 days after the accident.  A metal truss and metal plates now support Leah’s forearm and hand.  Leah was discharged from the hospital three days later on January 11 and her doctors estimate that it will take months and possibly up to two years for Leah to have complete use of her fingers, thumb and wrist.  Yet, throughout all this, Leah’s still smiling and joking.       In the meantime, John has been filling and delivering orders for their restaurants, hotels and major accounts, but their retail and catering side of their business are suspended indefinitely.  So, too, are their wildly popular “underground supper club,” held Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings.        As if it’s not tough enough to be handicapped for a year or more and suspending some business operations, the Lake Worth community, too, is feeling the effects of Leah’s accident.  Leah and John had been feeding the homeless every Monday as we as donating her fresh dry pasta  biweekly to Barten Elementary School.  Like the retail and catering side of their business, that, too, had to be deferred.       After medical insurance, there’s still a significant balance of $30,000 remaining on hospital and doctor bills.  That amount will increase because of the length of Leah’s anticipated recovery period.

Il y a actuellement une de nos consœurs de travail qui doit lutter pour sa vie. Elle a appris dernièrement qu’elle est atteinte d’un cancer du sein plutôt agressif. Elle débutera la semaine prochaine des traitements de chimiothérapie pour une durée de 5 mois, suivie d’opérations, et le tout couronné par de nombreux  traitements de radiothérapie. Ce combat je le connais bien puisque je l’ai moi-même mené. Cette travailleuse des postes aura besoin de toute son énergie pour guérir. Hors elle est employée à temps partiel, elle doit subvenir toute seule à ses besoins.  Autrement dit elle aura droit à 70% de de ses heures garanties, donc 70 % de 18h semaine. Si vous faites le calcul, elle va recevoir environ 200$ par semaine pour vivre. Ce qui sera nettement insuffisant pour payer les comptes habituels, se nourrir et payer les nombreux frais de déplacement, de médicaments en plus des frais de stationnement d’hôpital.   Lutter contre la maladie alors que l’on ne sait pas comment on fera pour payer le prochain loyer, ou pour faire une épicerie, personne ne devrait avoir à vivre cela.  Lorsque le cancer m’a frappé, ma famille et moi nous sommes retrouvées dans une situation très précaire. Sans le coup de main de plusieurs personnes autour de moi, je ne sais pas comment j’y serais arrivée. J’ai énormément de reconnaissance envers la vie et envers tous ceux qui ont contribué à ma guérison. Je crois énormément en « Donnez au suivant », c’est pourquoi je me permets de solliciter votre générosité pour permettre à cette femme formidable de concentrer toute son énergie sur sa guérison.

Pay it forward   Life is full of surprises, some of them good and some of them, not so good. One of our sisters is currently fighting for her life. She was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Starting next week, she will undergo chemo treatments for a five-month period, followed by surgeries, and radiation therapy. Her battle is one I am familiar with, since I also lived through it. This postal worker will need every ounce of energy she has to overcome this. Unfortunately, she is a part-time employee in a single-income family. In other words, she will only get paid 70% of her guaranteed hours, i.e. 70% of 18 hrs/week. This means she will have to survive on about $200.00 per week. This will clearly not be enough to pay the usual bills, buy food and pay for her medication and many trips to the hospital, including parking. Battling cancer when you have no idea how you’ll manage to pay your rent or buy food is something no one should have to go through. When I was diagnosed with cancer, my family and I ended up in a very difficult situation. Without the help of many people close to me, I don’t know how I would have managed. I am extremely thankful to all those who contributed to my recovery and allowed me to enjoy life, and I strongly believe in the need to pay it forward. That is why I am appealing to your generosity in asking you for donations so that this extraordinary woman can focus all her energy on her recovery.

My name is Isaiah and next week I will be traveling to Liberia in West Africa to volunteer with   , a non-profit that provides opportunities to children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities in West Africa.   My family came to the United States from Liberia in 1990 as refugees fleeing the First Liberian Civil War. The war and subsequent Second Liberian Civil War destroyed the country, leaving it with a decimated  healthcare system with little to no resources for the disabled.  My Heart’s Appeal aims to fill this void by facilitating the establishment of quality training and employment for the intellectually and developmentally challenged by: - Creating a safe campus in Liberia, to give teens and adults in West Africa with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to train, work and be productive. - Providing training programs for teachers and assistants to work effectively with people with disabilities. - Educating the public about the many skills and capabilities of people with intellectual disabilities. - Assisting in funding the purchase of special equipment, materials and transportation for deserving applicants. - Assisting in the cost of furthering the education of the mild, moderate or severe intellectually disabled children and adults. - Promoting respect, encouraging kindness and building self-esteem for persons with disabilities and their families.   Thanks to the kickstart from the UTA Foundation’s Live Inspired initiative, which offers employees the opportunity to apply for a grant and a one-week sabbatical to either “live a dream” or “give a dream”, I am able to live my dream of going back to my parents’ home country and volunteering with My Heart's Appeal for two weeks.   Currently, My Heart’s Appeal is building its first permanent facility: the Connie Thrash McGoodwin Vocational Training Hub. The hub will feature 10 classrooms and offer developmental courses in literacy, numeracy, agriculture, life skills, pastry, tailoring, woodworks, handicraft along with computer enrichment courses.

Any and all donations are accepted and appreciated. 100% of donations to this GoFundMe will go to My Heart's Appeal to help further their mission and contribute to the building of the McGoodwin Hub.

64,https://www.gofundme.com/f/6uoik9c,Flood Water Destruction,"My name is Christopher Thompson and we have had a devastating night. Last night my pregnant sister, my autistic niece, and my goofy brother-in-law lost nearly everything they had. After losing their home last year they moved in with a friend for several months, but eventually had to move in with my little family. I opened up my basement to them and they made a little home down there. Last night, the water moved faster than the pumps could keep up and reached 4ft in the deepest places, destroying nearly everything. My Pregnant sister has been devastated not being able to do much while we pulled as much as we could up. Luckily some church family came and helped pull stuff out, but it was after the fridge was already floating. So we've been calling everyone we can think of, insurance included, but I don't believe we will have enough to fix the basement as well as give them there life back. So I decided I needed to ask my friends and neighbors to help. My niece has been heart broken every time she sees a destroyed toy or ruined clothes. The monster high dolls are all gone and I'm not going to get into electronics. I know times are tough, but we could really use some help. If you would like to send Sierra a stuffed animal or something, PO Box 531, Taylorsville, In 47280. Keep us in your prayers.

65,https://www.gofundme.com/f/carolyn-madill-memorial-prayer-garden,Carolyn Madill Memorial Prayer Garden,"In the life of First Presbyterian Church, Dade City, Florida, Elder Carolyn Madill was a faithful and generous servant. Her vision of a Prayer Garden was born from a conversation  with her pastor in which she expressed her pride in her son Chris’ ability to  regrow about anything that was “ looking puny ”. She was often known to take home plants used in the sanctuary which, after several weeks, were near death. A few months later, she would return them healthy and renewed for use at church again. She wished aloud that there was a prayer garden for some of those plants that Chris nursed back to life. That comment sparked what is now a “work in progress ”.  The Prayer Garden, which will be located at the back of the church property, is intended to be a vocal point for both church and community. And as she intended, a sermon without words, reminding us of “our need always to pray and never lose heart”.  With symbols of faith, it will provide a feast for the eyes and soul. Plans include walkways, special bricks to honor loved ones, a water feature, the play of sunlight on trees, flowers, and herbs, especially those mentioned in scripture. Places to sit, pray, rest, paths to walk and markers identifying special plantings will provide a restful learning environment. Work gloves, gardening tools and a weeding stool (for those who love to pray while working) will be included. Such is her legacy and her hope for the future.",1549612800,20000,10,0,https://images.gofundme.com/pQ_lsYDGOKTnjzv1J_6-yifX10s=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36920408_154962873064396_r.jpeg,,730,a woman in a red shirt and a red tie,nan,

71,https://www.gofundme.com/f/tj9bqj,Breast Cancer is a BITCH!,"Charleen has been a friend to me since the very early 90s. Through the years, she has been consistently loving, selfless, humble, and honest to her core. As an adult, I've never experienced someone this close to me being diagnosed with cancer. Let me share her discovery with you. While showering one day, Charleen came across what she describes as a lump on the side of her left breast. ""It’s on the side so I was washing under my arm and brushed up against it. It was large enough for me to feel my arm rub up against (it)."" After a discussion with her mom, she dismissed it as a fatty deposit. But as she describes, she had a nagging sense that it could be something more. Charleen's most recent mammogram was two years prior to discovering this lump and there was absolutely nothing found. She discussed it with her mom again and, together, they decided she needed to be examined by a medical professional. Charleen always impressed me with her entrepreneurial spirit. She owned and operated her own business in a male dominated industry for five successful years before succumbing to the economy and making the heartbreaking decision to close down and find traditional employment. After a stint as a temp, she was finally offered a full time role and became eligible for health insurance.  Her health insurance kicked in and she made an appointment for a physical...a checkup with her primary care physician. She was scheduled for a mammogram ... then an ultrasound...then a biopsy. Diagnosis...grade 3 fucking breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma. Plan...lumpectomy (decided against the mastectomy), chemo for a year, then radiation five times a week for six weeks.  Wow. In the span of two weeks, her life changed forever.  My friend, Charleen, is recovering from her lumpectomy as I write this. She's tired, exhausted, in pain. And yet, the worst part is that she is stressing out about not being at work, earning a paycheck. Chemo begins later this month.  It's sobering. As a friend, I'm at a loss.  I am searching for a way to make this better for her, to help her in some way. I want this to go away. I want to wave my magic wand and make this disappear for her. I'm learning that it just doesn't work that way. Fuck! Why not???  Please help me help Charleen. Please join me in my friendship and amplify my love for her. She's a single person, lives alone..well not alone..she has her doggy baby, a cocker spaniel named Noodle that needs her to be around!!! Charleen doesn't like to ask for ""handouts."" She doesn't want to ask strangers for that. Well, I don't look at it that way. I'm not asking for a handout. I'm asking for humanity to kick in. I'm asking for you to help my friend that has helped so many during her life journey. I'm asking that if this message resonates with you...that you will help my friend pay for her medicine, for her treatment, for her days missed at work because she's busy getting chemo and trying to recover from it.  Get to know Charleen. She is a true friend to everyone she meets, even if you aren't a Raiders fan.

I am a Junior Secondary School math teacher at the Agricultural and Vocational Secondary School (AVSS) in Gerihun where I would like to paint a map of Sierra Leone depicting the districts, as well as a map of the world.  A painted map of the world is a typical project for foreign teachers. I believe that a map of the world will help the students at AVSS understand how large the world is, and how many countries encompass each continent.  As a village school, they do not have many resources available to their students. This map would add value to the school, and also be a teaching tool for social studies classes.    I would also like to paint the alphabet on the three primary schools in Gerihun. Students are not often taught the specifics of letter placement on a page, and by painting the alphabet with lines above and below each letter, students will be better equipped to write when they go past the primary level.  I estimate the world map to cost around 1,200,000 Leones, which is about $130. The map of Sierra Leone, around 950,000 Leones, or $105 And all three alphabets are around 1,000,000 Leones, or $110 These expenses include pencils to draw grid lines for the maps and outlines for the alphabet, paint brushes, paint, paint paint remover (to touch up rough edges), and lunch for students who will be helping me.  This project is a bit time sensitive, as dry season ends in June. If possible I would like to start painting by the latest, March 2019.  Receiving donations for this project would mean a great deal for this community. Every student in Gerihun will benefit from this project, as it will be painted outside each school for children of all ages to look upon.   Thank you so much for reading, and if you are not able to donate, I hope you will share this project on social media to spread the word for a noble cause.

We found Frobert in his enclosure Sunday night very swollen and moving slowly.  Monday he was worse, with tremors in his little legs and working hard to breathe.  Dr. Stewart took on his case Monday, and after some tests, found that Frobert’s calcium is very low.  We had followed the instructions we were given at the pet store, feeding his crickets a calcium supplement and so forth, and I felt terrible to learn this news. Dr. Stewart is also checking for other things that may be contributing to his condition, and has been treating him carefully with soaks in special “amphibian lactated ringers” solution to try to help bring off some of the swelling.  Frobert is also getting calcium injections under the skin.  He has made small and slow improvements, and you can see from the pictures in the hospital that he is looking better and taking feedings from a tiny catheter.   Dr. Stewart expects his recovery to be slow, and we are so hopeful that this little guy pulls through.  He was a gift from a friend who found him in her kiddie pool last summer, and we raised him from a tadpole.  Once he turned into an adorable froglet, we were in love, and when we read that his chances of living to one year old in the wild were around 40 percent, we thought we’d try to make a life for him that we could share. The clinic is working with us to keep costs down as much as they can.  Still, diagnostic testing, treatments and an inpatient stay for a critter adds up, and every bit helps.  Our kids brainstormed, and would like to offer a gift in exchange for any donations to help keep our mission to look after Frobert as he gets treated afloat.

The estimated cost of the installation is $18,500 excluding any benches or additional items.

While they are currently utilizing the back of two pick-up trucks, as the Academy grows their desire is to purchase a van that would transport Rhinos to and from soccer matches, excursions and other opportunities beyond their small community. One of the Fosters' wish list items is to secure a new van in 2019. And so, I have partnered with our favorite local St. Augustine inn, The Collector Inn & Luxury Gardens, to give away a FREE overnight at their amazing location. For a $20 donation towards the Fosters' new van, all entrants will receive an entry to a Sunday-Thursday eligible overnight at the romantic inn, The Collector Inn & Luxury Gardens, located in the heart of historic St. Augustine, FL. To enter, please donate $20 (donations exceeding $20 will result in multiple entries (ex: $40 will get 2 entries) through this GoFundMe link. Be sure to enter you name (vs. staying Anonymous) to be eligible to win.  This overnight can be used on any Sunday-Thursday in 2019 based on availability.  Restrictions apply to holidays and November 16-January 6, 2020.  No additional fees apply; valet parking and breakfast included.  An official certificate will be mailed to the winning recipient. The Collector is an adult only property as of January 2019. Winner will be announced on January 31 at 7:00pm EST.

My brother and his friends are still alive by the grace of the Lord. Kris had been shot more than 5 times and had to undergo 4 surgeries all in one day.   My brother is one of the most caring and giving person i know, and even after this horrible tragedy, can still smile in as much pain as he is in right now.  He helps out anyone and everyone, and never expects a thing in return.  After the horrible night he had to go through and the last couple days in the hospital, the one thing hes most worried about is how is he ever going to pay his hospital bill, along with the therapy and life altering changes hes going to have to go through. As much as i feel the shooters should pay for this,  they arent exactly just going to ask for his bill and pay it for him.  Hes going to be hospitalized for the next couple of months and unfortunately lost his job because of this happening. We are going to also have to find somewhere else to live because the police believe that these guys are going to come back and ""finish the job"" since my brother survived.  So please, this is definitely going to require our help and hopefully your generosity. This Gofundme account is going to provide my brother the necessary money to not only rebuild his life, but also rebuild him a wheelchair accessible bathtub because he will not be able to stand up and shower after being discharged.  So please,  i ask of everyone to keep not only Kristopher but all the victims as well in your prayers and if possible, consider a donation to my little brother who needs our help. I will provide updates on his progress through his healing and physical therapy and for sure would definitely be less stress on him and our family.

We are hoping to ease some of the financial burden and shed light on this dangerous disease that takes the lives of so many people. We found out about the diagnosis in August of 2018. Prior to this diagnosis, my mom was seeking treatment for kidney stones and fibroids. We were actively in doctors offices at the time yet no one caught the tumor growing inside of her until it was stage 4 (Final Stage). This really came as a huge shock to us. We are heartbroken.  My mom is currently going through chemotherapy treatment at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, a non profit cancer research/treatment center. She has already been through 11 rounds of chemo. A huge accomplishment and a hard thing to get through. Her results show a small shrinkage but not enough to get surgery to remove it. We are now looking at getting radiation treatment for a little bit and then eventually surgery. Her daughter Alicia will be making regular updates on how her treatment is going and her survival to be stage 4 cancer.    Any person going through this needs all the love and support that they can get and to stay strong during this critical time.  We want to surround her with love and happiness. We are hoping she can beat cancer and continue to cross things off her bucket list.  Please spread the word. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

101,https://www.gofundme.com/f/6uo6sb4,Saving Sean - Raising For Care Costs,"2019 began with Sean, my husband, coming down with a cold. He had trouble breathing that we assumed was a side effect of the illness. The cold cleared up, but the tightness in his chest did not. Then more issues popped up, including fatigue and lack of appetite. Again, we chalked it up to his cold moving into his lungs and treated it as such. But on the evening of January 28th, Sean noticed that his feet and legs felt swollen. Sure enough, his calves and feet were swollen to the point where he had difficulties lifting his legs into the vehicle so that he could be taken to the ER. That night, at East Georgia Regional Medical Center, changed our world. Over the next few days, Sean was told that he had suffered a heart attack, had congestive heart failure, and possibly had pneumonia. In addition, we discovered that Sean was in renal failure, needed to be put on the kidney transplant list, and would need to begin dialysis as soon as possible. We were told Medicaid would cover everything and that things would begin to improve as soon as Sean received dialysis. He was released on Saturday evening, February 2nd, after being told he would be getting a call from a local surgeon on Monday the 4th to set up catheter surgery to allow him to begin dialysis. We thought everything had been taken care of and were happy to have Sean back home. However, the time since his release has been one disappointment after another. Because we do not have insurance, the surgeon’s office would not schedule an appointment without a $315 payment for the consult. We discovered that someone from the hospital should have come by to assist Sean in filing for Medicaid, but no one even came by to ask if he even had insurance. The hospital provided outdated and incorrect insurance information to the doctors that provided care for Sean, so we have started to receive bills that have been adjusted for insurance purposes- meaning the actual overall cost is unknown. We were able to get Sean’s application for Medicaid filed, but we have not received any response as of yet. We were able to get someone to arrange a consult with the surgeon without charge, but the hospital refuses to schedule surgery because Sean is a “cash customer”. Yes, a customer. My husband is 43 years old. His name is Sean Dewberry and he is dying because we cannot afford to pay for his healthcare costs. Thank you for taking the time to read his story.

103,https://www.gofundme.com/f/yaw6uu-help-max-fight-cancer,Help Max Fight Cancer ❤️,"Aubry and I found out that our sweet boy has (low-grade) Oral Melanoma. My heart is completely broken that I need to make this GoFund Me page.   What is Melanoma?  “Melanoma is a cancer of the melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the body. The most common site for melanoma tumors to occur in the dog is in the mouth. Melanoma very aggressive . Oral melanomas also have a high chance of metastasizing (spreading) to other parts of the body. The most common locations for melanoma to spread are lymph nodes within the head and neck, and the lungs.”  How did we find out? On 02/01/19,  We took Max to get his annual teeth cleaning. The vet found a small lesion in his mouth. A biopsy was taken.  What are the next steps? We need to take him to an Oncologist. He will need  chest X-rays to make sure the cancer has not spread. In addition, he will need to get the small lesion removed from his gum line ASAP. We will know more as we go.  The good news is that it is a low-grade lesion. This means that it is less aggressive and has hopefully not spread yet.  So if we act fast, there could be a good prognosis for him.  Why do we need financial help? Cancer treatment for dogs is very expensive. Aubry and I are both college students.  We have been very blessed to be relatively financially secure. Unfortunately, we have recently spent the majority of our savings on both of our dogs.  All of our pets (2 dogs,1 cat) are on wellness plans. So we pay monthly for routine vet visits, shots, dental cleanings...etc. Having them on these plans makes routine care extremely affordable for us.  Anything outside of routine care is not included. Over the past 2 weeks we have spent over $1,200 on our 2 dogs. Max had to have 2 teeth extracted, mouth X-ray and the biopsy. Then Athena just had to have 6 teeth extracted and mouth x-rays (her previous owner severely neglected her).  We will spend any amount of money on our babies.  Their happiness and health is a priority! Sadly this situation was not expecting and is way out of our league financially.  We will be applying for grants through non-profit organizations. Those take awhile to get a response and there are long waiting lists. We need to get started on his treatment now!  Here is a bit about Max: He is a sweet 9 year old Corgi/Golden Retriever mix. Max was found 8 years ago running down the street during a monsoon. He is terrified of storms to this day!  My bestfriend took him in as a foster pup without blinking an eye (she is an angel!).  I took one look at him and fell in love.   He has been my rock through the hardest times of my life. He has saved me in so many ways, now it’s my turn to save him.  Many of you know some of my story. Max kept me from giving up. He is a big reason I am here today.  He is my first true love and takes a huge spot in my heart!  Max loves soft stuffed animals. He prefers the ones for humans, not dogs.  He never chews them up. He treats them like they are his babies.  Oh and He LOVES food... a lot!  All he wants in this world is his moms, his stuffed babies, cuddles and food. We want to give that too him for many more years.",1549612800,6500,0,0,https://images.gofundme.com/ctt2z6SHWBQvm8qNPEBA-m9T744=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36919058_1550567978498823_r.jpeg,,610,a small dog is standing on a skateboard .,nan,

We were able to raise funds for baby Mustapha, Baby Mariama, Carlos  and Baby Marian. We are now trying to raise funds for Badamasi, Aminata, Abu and Mustapha. Please let us help in any little way we can as the health care services in Sierra Leone is not equipped to handle the emerging cases and these children are coming from the provinces and from very poor families. See Stories for the current children we are raising funds for below.  2 years old   is suffering from  . Both his kidney has been affected and the left one more affected.  On the 1st October 2018 the mother discovered that he is urinating blood and they immediately rushed with him to the PCMH (Cottage Hospital) where he was examined and as the parents were not very satisfied they decided to move to Emergency. It was at emergency they referred us to Connaught Hospital where Badamasie was admitted for 2 weeks. During this two weeks, we carried out CT scan and abdominal scan. After this scan that was led by our only Paediatric Surgeon Dr. Aiah Lebbie confirmed that one of the kidneys is packed and the other is having Tumor.  Currently Badamasie needs a total of $16,000USD we have reached out to the Ministry of Health and Sanitation to request for medical assistance, but even if government is able to provide some support they will not provide all, so we are reaching out to the general public seek your donation. As always nothing is too small, let us donate to save life.    16 years old   is currently suffering from  , her face is swell now in a scary way, she requires a 3 cycles of chemotherapy before her surgery and another 3 cycles of chemotherapy after her surgery to help deal with this situation thoroughly. She hailed from a village called Dundukor in Koinadugu District. Her ailment started 2009 and in 2011 Mercy Ship did the first surgery on her, but there was not much of chemotherapy being done, and in 2012 again it resurfaced again and has got to a scary state again, in 2017 things became more worrying as she had to drop out of school at high school. Aminata is always crying that she wants to go back to school and if she is cured she will study hard to be a medical doctor.  Aminata is currently suffering and needs urgent help, to fix this condition, for both the surgery and the chemotherapy it will cost $26,000 USD    3-year-old   was born without an anus, he has hirschsprung’s disease which is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. In 2018 he was operated (colostomy) to create a stoma which is what he is currently using. Basically the intestine was diverted to another direction and  hole was created so that he can excr ete through the created hole or stoma. Jeremiah is suffering daily and is in serious pain. Please lets donate to save him. The Max Super Speciality in India has gave us a discounted rate of $ 8,000 USD for the surgery fee to do the reversal and give him back an anus so he can be a normal child.      14 years old   is suffering from   (a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord) he does not have anus and had defunct legs and sexual organ.  It is worth indicating that Treatment can help, but this condition can't be cured fully.  Mustapha was born with this condition, but has been managing until recent times when he could not even hold on to his urine anymore and had to drop out of school.

Our participants are adults, many of whom have not made art since childhood. Some take a few weeks to pick up a brush or a slab of clay...some dive into the process right away. Either way, the results astound both instructor and student!  Every session is heartfelt and an emotionally fueling experience. One of our newest members, for example, is 95 years old. Last week, she completed her very first painting ever! (It is an image of her honeymoon)  Another member is a refugee from Afghanistan. (Her entire family was killed in front of her) Every week, she brings us small gifts of food and at least one painting. Through art and human connection, we are able to forego our language barrier...she brings light everywhere she goes! M. is from Ukraine. He lives with a number of physical and mental disabilities. He creates with a vigor and energy such that an entire wall of our studio is dedicated to his work and he is now famous in the building for his brilliant art! R. has been blind from birth. In our studio, he has been able to make his wish for painting, a reality! He is also a musician, and on days when he isn't painting, he brings his flute and our studio transforms into the most magical of live music venues.  There are hundreds of other stories and so many heartfelt moments. Our group is growing through our time together. We've witnessed friendships start and artists blossom. Our visitors are a compassionate and supportive group. For every art show we have held, people have generously donated their time to help. When we announced that our funding is being cut, members offered their work for sale to donate back to the program.  Up to December 2018, our program has been funded through grants provided by the Ontario Arts Council, The Toronto Arts Council and Cota. Due to recent political events and resulting cuts to Arts funding we have been denied further funding for the time being. This is why we are reaching out to the broader community for help! The funds donated to The Acorn Arts Project go towards providing staff and art materials for our members. Thank you so so much for your donations, big or small. Every bit will go towards keeping our doors open!!

Lawr also left behind CREATiVESPORTS, a fantasy sports company he founded in 1996 and relaunched in 2017, with a focus on smart, original commentary. It began with baseball, which remained its core, but expanded to football, hockey, golf, soccer and more. Not only was Lawr an accomplished and respected writer, he took pride in providing a platform to foster and mentor those new to the fantasy writing community. This was perfectly reflected by   , not only a home for Lawr’s influential voice, but also for aspiring writers, including a number who later transitioned into the mainstream media. In that spirit Todd Zola, with the help of Brian Walton and the encouragement of Lawr’s wife Diane, yearn to keep Lawr’s legacy a vibrant mainstay in the fantasy sports community, continuing to mentor fledgling writers while sharing Lawr’s passion for fantasy sports, preparing aspiring writers for the next step, be it in fantasy or traditional sports.

He lives on his own and supports himself and has done so for years. He has a wonderful resume already, but needs his college degree to further his career goals for becoming a fulltime Cello teacher. The trips will take more than the amount listed because he has saved money for this and wants to pay his way. It's an honor that he was chosen by these colleges to audition.

124,https://www.gofundme.com/f/xmndd-support-my-work-with-the-sanctuary-caravan,Support ongoing work w/ asylum seekers in Tijuana,"**UPDATE** I am back from working two weeks in Tijuana with asylum seekers. The conditions in Tijuana are brutal for those seeking safety in the US. There is so much work to be done that my work there is not finished. A fellow volunteer is keeping our community space open and operating for the sometimes hundreds of people that come through our door daily. The community space (or ""The Office"" as we call it) offers people a bathroom, shower, at least one meal a day, coffee, water, charge electronics, a play area for children, art supplies, books, and a safe space for people to take a break. It was originally only supposed to a be a short-term solution, but it was quickly realized that the services provided are absolutely essential so we are trying to keep The Office up and running. We also continue to do accompaniment every morning before the office opens. This is extremely hard work and people's support means everything. The money donated before helped with my travel expenses and the remainder was used to purchase supplies for The Office, including art supplies that were used in amazing ways. While we are in need of physical donations, monetary is best so volunteers in the office can purchase what is needed most that week. More asylum seekers arrive daily and under Trump's new asylum policy, we are also dealing with individuals and families who have been returned to Tijuana to await their US court date....often 6-8 weeks away. They are brought back to Tijuana with nothing and services on the Tijuana side are almost non-existent. Part of the money raised will still pay for travel (and extra suitcase to bring physical donations with me), but almost all will go to what is needed to keep The Office up and running. No donation is too small - If people chip in $5 or $10 it makes a world of difference.  I have also developed a presentation on my experience and on the asylum process as a whole and the changes that were made. If you would like me to come speak to a group, please reach out and I am more than happy to.  Thank you to everyone who donated before, all who are donating now and those who cannot donate, but are sending lots of love <3 Asylum seekers and refugees fleeing violence and persecution need safe passage.  We are a group of volunteers from all over the country who support the thousands of asylum applicants currently waiting in Tijuana to be processed. As a volunteer, I am helping our migrant friends navigate this bureaucracy, and then accompany them as they cross the border. I am asking you to support my work  at this time when the most vulnerable among us are being targeted by hateful rhetoric and physical violence.  I am raising funds to travel to San Diego/Tijuana for this work to work with migrants there. As a volunteer, I pay for my own travel, lodging and expenses. My goal is to raise $7,000.  A bit more about myself:  I believe that people have the right to migrate. I also believe that the current violence—both physical and bureaucratic—being directed at asylum seekers who have gathered at the border is immoral. All Sanctuary Caravan volunteers are committed to nonviolence, and we are equally committed to standing for liberty and equality for all people. For those who have no idea who I am, I have been a community organizer for over 15 years. I work mostly on civil rights and human rights issues. I have always told people that I go where I'm needed and people are currently needed in Tijuana. It is also prompted by my 6-year-old daughter Lily who has demanded I go to help. She is firmly against the wall and believes we should help everyone seeking asylum (yeah my kid is kind of awesome). As she put it ""those are new friends mama, can you go help them?"" Yes Lily I can. I have never done a GFM for myself before. I feel weird about doing this, but travel and accommodations can be pricey and people have asked how they can help. Every donation will go towards another day of me being able to help at the border. And yes, I definitely plan on giving updates from the field as much as possible (while protecting my new friends' identities and information). If you are not able to donate, please share....and send some happy juju to everyone at the border <3 Again, funds that you contribute will go directly for my travel to assist migrants on the Tijuana/US border. Thank you very much for your support.

These were the early symptoms of what would later be diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. It was devestating. The disease disrupts signals from the brain, and can impair muscle control, movement, vision and temperature sensitivity. It’s progressive, incurable and unpredictable, with “attacks,” causing the effects to temporarily worsen. Admittedly, I made some poor business decisions and had a few painful life events. A trusted employee embezzled $40,000, and having spent a good amount renovating a large house in Quincy — as a retirement investment - the house’s equity was wiped out when housing market crashed. It was financially ruinous. So now, I want to build a house specifically designed for Jo’s needs - so we can stay together for the rest of our lives. I’ve finished the construction plans for an 800-sq.-ft. — small  yet cozy home. It will be built next to our existing house, where my daughter and grandchildren will live. Technology driven, everything in the house will be voice controlled. Jo Ann’s MS has slowly taken away one after another of her abilities. She has those temporary low episodes, but the following highs, seem to get lower each time. It’s not a matter of if, but when. The prospect of her living in a nursing home.... I’m not going to let that happen.  We have to stay together This house will make that possible. And, Its  why getting this built as quickly as possible is so critical. She’ll be close to the kids, which is important. I’m  doing the project inside out – having bought, a little at a time, pretty much the  entire interior – bathroom and kitchen fixtures, appliances, the automation voice control components and more.  We’ll use the last of our savings, then we will be tapped out.  We’re reaching out to friends. Many of you know Jo’s needs, and I hope you can recognize we’ve taken it as far we can on our own. I believe in the goodness of people – and I think you can see yourself in this and realize that —  if not for a break here or a piece of luck there….

Doctors said he would have died if he wasn't brought in when he was.  His resting heart rate was at 140.  He had pneumonia caused by an abscess around his lung, which required placement of a drain tube.  The abscess tested positive for strep, and John also had a blood infection.

The front of his throat was cut to remove the infection and place a drain tube.

On December 21, 2018, I went to MD Anderson in Houston and was officially diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. I never thought in a million years this would happened to me after everything that has happened.  As many of you know, my mother Neri lost her battle to cervical cancer after fighting for three years in March 2018. I didnt think that I would also be diagnosed with cancer that same year at age 27.   In October, I had a ultrasound done through a screening service at the elementary school that I work for. The ultrasound scanned my thyroid, kidneys, and other organs to check and see if everything was ok. I sign up for the ultrasounds not expecting to found anything in scans but you never know.  In November, the results from the scans come in and they found a nodule on my left thyroid that was  suspicious and to go see a doctor. So I went and had another ultrasound done on my thyroid and the results came back with news I never thought I would hear. “You may or may not have cancer, but it doesn’t look good.”  I immediately scheduled an appointment with MD Anderson in Houston and the words “It’s cancer” stopped me in my tracks. I couldn’t believe this is real... One thing is certain, this will not stop me! I am blessed that my treatment is surgery and hopefully the doctors will be able to remove 100% of the cancer in my thyroid and I can move now from this chapter in my life.

For those of you that don’t know me too well, I am a mother of four beautiful little girls that I am now left to raise without their father’s because their lives were taken away due to gun violence. In honor of my oldest daughter JaBreeah Batey, I’m trying to raise money for an amazing opportunity. JaBreeah was nominated by her teacher of Northaven Elementary School to participate in an envision program to be held at Loyola University in Chicago, IL and Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, OH this summer 2019. The invitation reads: In Honor of your Maturity, Academic Excellence, and Leadership Potential, You are Cordially Invited to Participate in the National Youth Leadership Forum: Pathways to STEM. It was stated that only the brightest, most highly motivated students are singled out by their teachers for nomination. It also stated that JaBreeah was selected because her teacher recognizes her as a student who already demonstrates exceptional maturity, scholastic merit, and leadership potential even at her young age. NYLF Pathways to STEM is designed to give future leaders like JaBreeah an unprecedented opportunity while still in elementary school to discover their personal strengths and to begin to acquire the leadership and life skills needed for academic and career success. JaBreeah will join other young students from around the region in intensive, engaging, hands-on workshops focused on five skills that are essential to success: self management, time management, communication, collaboration, and goal setting. JaBreeah will also have the opportunity to explore a future career in these exciting STEM pathways: engineering, medicine, and detective work. JaBreeah will even practice medical techniques during a realistic simulation titled When Care Is Hours Away. The letter goes on speaking highly of these students and this outstanding program. We are very proud of this achievement and JaBreeah is more than excited and anxious to participate, but I’m not sure if that will happen due to financial pressure. Tuition for the residential program at Loyola University and Bowling Green State University is $2,295. That includes all curriculum instruction, all program activities and evening events, overnight housing, program materials, and all breakfasts, lunches, snacks, and dinners during the program.

136,https://www.gofundme.com/f/bxymu-help-me-get-my-daughter-back,Help me get my daughter back,"On June 19, 2018, my 4 year old daughter was kidnapped by my parents. I had made a commitment to volunteer for a creation based ministry over the summer for a period of one month. My parents beliefs differ from mine regarding creation vs evolution, and they did not support my decision to serve in this ministry. On the day we were supposed to leave, my parents had planned out and executed a kidnapping to keep me from taking my daughter with me to what they would claim to be a cult. In reality, it is a 501(c)(3) ministry, a status that would not be granted to an actual cult. They did this without any sort of court order or permission from a judge or DHR. My mother, after successfully stealing my child went to family court to file for emergency custody of my daughter and a protective order against me. Both of these were petitioned for and obtained with false allegations and outright fraud. I have since been fighting for my rights as best I can. After 205 days, 4 continuances, an attorney that didn’t show up and quit after being paid $1,300, another “volunteer” attorney that said he took my case but never actually did, and currently, a court appointed attorney who can only represent me in one aspect of this multi-faceted case, I have decided to reach out for help. I have been working hard and saving on my own and had saved about  $2,000, most of which I planned on going towards paying a retainer for a quality attorney, however, recently I had to put over $1,500 into repairs and tires for my car, which is my source of income as I am a delivery driver. I am now back to square one trying to earn enough funds to hire an attorney. I hate even asking for money, but at this point, I am out of options. This case is being drug out and my rights are being trampled due to my lack of adequate representation. I fear that due to the length of time my parents have been able to have temporary custody of my daughter, the judge will be less inclined to remove her from their care regardless of the fraudulent means in which they obtained temporary custody. I sincerely hope if you have read this far that you will prayerfully consider donating to my cause. I am a God-fearing Christian and a loving and capable father. My daughter adores me and wants to be able to live with me, as she has expressed several times during the limited, supervised visitations I have been able to have with her.

On December 17th, 2018, Lacey was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. This is a rare form of Leukemia. Upon diagnosis, already 50% of her bone marrow was leukemia. She was also Neutropenic (meaning that her white blood cell count was so low that she had no defenses.) The doctors were shocked that she was still fighting. Even the common cold could’ve killed her. But Lacey is a fighter, always has been.  No time was wasted, on December 18th, Lacey was transferred to USC Cancer Center.  Just when Lacey and the family thought she’d get to go home for a few weeks until her next round of Chemo...On January 9th, it was discovered that the Initial Induction Chemo was unsuccessful. She will need another round of chemo, which will require a minimum of 6 more weeks in the hospital.  Lacey is a mom to an 8 year old girl and a 9 year old boy.  Prior to her diagnosis, Lacey was a daycare provider, a business in which she had to give up due to her being in the hospital for 2 months and counting. Even after she returns home, she won’t be able to provide childcare ever again.  By her side, her wife Jessica has remained. Also making it hard for Jessica to work and continue to provide a home for her kids, someone to assist with raising them, getting them to school etc.  Jessica is a mental health worker, Lacey a daycare provider, together they’ve devoted their lives to helping and serving others (from their jobs, to their often feeding the homeless, donating to the needy, etc) Now it’s time to give back, to help a family that truly deserves it.

It was found in my left breast and later in my liver. I had two mastectomy’s and a liver resection as well as a very tough chemo that I got great results from. Iv done 6 weeks of daily radiation and I made I’d to NED ( no evidence of disease ) status about a year after diagnosis. That lasted for about 6 months before progression to my abdominal lymph nodes showed up in March of 2018. I started chemo again and have been on carbo Platin and gemcitamine every 3 weeks since then. This summer I showed new symptoms and it turns out that the cancer has spread to my tibia bone which is now at a high risk for fracture. It is very painful and pain meds don’t seem to help at all. I am currently discussing with my doctors about doing a surgery to remove the tumor from my bone and filling it with cement and adding a metal plate for extra support. This should take away the pain and allow me to go back to regular activities without worry of fracture. I have a Facebook page that I post regular updates on and I will do my best to post updates on here as well.   am a stay at home mom to a now 3 year old, who keeps me busy and always smiling.

Weighing 1 lb, 6 oz. each, they have spent the majority of their first 6 months fighting for their lives.   Amanda and Nate, their mom and dad, have faced an introduction to parenthood that no one should have to face.  The first weeks, with the odds stacked against them, the fragility of Calvin and Amelia's lives was minute to minute.  There were complications that seemed to keep coming for both babies.  They both ended up being transferred to Seattle Children's hospital when their conditions were extremely critical and they needed life saving surgeries. Calvin and Amelia are fighters.  They have endured so much.  We have all watched in amazement as they have grown and continued to beat the odds.  While there is tremendous relief in their stability today, they have a long road ahead of them and their family needs our support. Just before Christmas,  Amelia was able to go home for the first time.  This transition has been bittersweet as Calvin remains in the PICU at Seattle Children's.  Amanda, Nate and Amelia spend several hours a week commuting between their home in Federal Way and the hospital to be with Calvin.   Due to the immaturity of Calvin's lungs, he has a tracheotomy and is still relying on a ventilator to breathe.  Amanda and Nate will be going through extensive training to care for him before he can come home.  Calvin will need home care nurses as he will need 24 hour support from someone trained in tracheotomy care.  This also means that during car rides, there will need to be a trained caregiver in the backseat with him insuring his ability to breathe.  Amanda and Nate will not be able to bring Calvin home until they have an accessible vehicle.   I have created this GoFundMe to raise money for them to purchase a vehicle that can accommodate the babies and their needed caregivers.  Amanda and Nate are both incredibly generous, kind people who have always gone above and beyond to help others.   It is our turn to shower them with our love and support and to remind them that they are not alone on this journey. Thank you so much to all who have read this and to those who are able to give.

I am not a facility, I am a 1 person team that runs my rescue out of my basement in my house (Kitty Lounge). I do everything by myself, I do the trapping, replying to emails, text messages, transporting of cats, all the vetting, socializing the kitties,  sometimes have to bring a kitty to work that is in critical condition and needs 24 hr care.  I do all the adoption processing its a lot of work and is worth every minutes of it!  Unfortunately, I don't get any funding to help with the community over population with kittens and cats so this is why I am going to start this GoFundMe so you to can help me save lives.  I was occasionally doing a facebook fundraiser however it has a time limit so I am going to try GoFundMe and keep it going for the 2019 year. I have a process when I rescue cats/kittens I trap and get them fully vetted, neutered/spayed, vaccinated with rabies and distemper, dewormed and a treated for fleas and eat mites.   I will determine if they can be adopted or have to be released back.  I have only had to release 2 back into the outdoors (fully vetted)  I have converted my basement into a Kitty Lounge (just for them) equipped with a fireplace, 2 couches, cat houses, cat trees, toys, anything they need to get use to living indoors.   This helps tremendously with socializing the kitties.  When people want to adopt a cat/kitten from me I encourage them to come to the kitty lounge and relax and get up close and personal to all the kitties  so they can pick a kitty that they connect with.  Some of the kittens and cats I rescue are very sick, I will do anything to get the kitty back to health, no matter how many trips I have to make to the vet.  A sick Kitty is where is starts costing me a lot of money, I do not belive in euthanizing unless I have no choice or if the kitty is suffering.  I spend anywhere from $400.00-$1800.00/month now on vet bills and medication and special food for cats that require it,  depending how bad of shape the kitty is in and how many I rescued that month. (Not including food and cat litter) P.S  thanks to all of you who have come to the Kitty lounge to donate food and cat litter! its means so much to me.  Our local Humane Society is full and turning people away, they are at their max limit with cats.  I am getting unlimited calls to help strays in our community and its getting over whelming. These poor cats are either born outside or dumped on the streets by previous owners, its not fair and my heart aches for them.  They suffer so much every winter. For example I have a recent pregnant young kitty (9 months old) named Honey right now she was found trying to keep warm under cars in a Walmart parking lot. This evening I am off to trap 4 small kittens with no mom, its -10 degrees right now :(  its never ends, and I am asking for help to help me save more lives.  Often people ask me why I do this? how do you find the time when you are  working, raising a family and being a wife?. well.... its easy, I do it because I am passionate about it and I am good at it and most importantly my husband and children are my biggest support team :)  If you prefer to send an e-transfer my email is kitchenerstraycatrescue@gmail.com and make the password savethecats Thank you for helping me save more lives, every penny helps!

On December 27,2018 Miranda was admitted to the hospital in Lubbock,TX, due to baby Jaxson not growing.  They told her in about 3 weeks, they would be delivering their baby boy by c-section.  Everything had been going great and he was looking great on the monitors. On January 8,2019, they did a fluid level check and weight check on the sonogram. That’s when they discovered the fluid around him was low and he had only gained 3oz since December 4th. I had told them to go ahead and get with Ronald McDonald House, to get everything planned out for when they release Miranda. But they are full and don’t know if they will have a room for them. So if they don’t have a room, that means they will be having to rent a room, until one does come open. With them delivering their baby boy yesterday and him having to be in the NICU, I know Ramiro had to be worrying, about how he was going to be able to provide for his little family while Jaxson was in the hospital and how he would rent a room plus buy food, when he will be having to be off without pay. So with their permission, I have created this to help take some of the weight off of Ramiro’s shoulders, and he can focus on his son and Miranda.

He just got home from the hospital now in General Santos City, Philippines.  Still isn't doing well and now it will be at least 4 weeks before we can try again.

She’s a fighight the Lyme disease and Brest Cancer currently and She is recovering from an intense back surgery involving her L5 disk in the spine. She had strong leg pains and the doctor told her if they could shave the disk down it would relief pressure and pain. She has an 80% chance of getting better. We were sent home the next day. Once we left the roads in Corpus were very bumpy and caused her unfortunate pain.  When we returned to Laredo, the same night my grandma needed to go to Doctors Hospital in Laredo. Where they could only give her a pain relief medicine and sent her home.  The Next day, she gets a fever and vomiting and we needed to attend the Laredo Medical Center ER. Where they told us they couldn’t do anything due to the procedure being done out of town. So we were forced to go back to Corpus on the 5th where the doctor only amplified her medications. And told her to return home and if she noticed anything off or felt pain to go to the ER. On our way home she started experiencing drainage as she stood up. So we took her to Hospital for the 3rd time. And were told to go back to Corpus to get stitching and to get monitor for any infections.  She is currently in the Laredo Hosptial awaiting to get transported to another Hosptal in Corpus. We ask for you help assisting us with medical expenses for transportation, meals, and medications. After a 3rd time of having to come back and forth hospitals to hosptial isn’t always affordable in emergencies like these.  May God bless y’all! Please send prayers for a sooner recovery. The spine and brain are two very important body part and any complication can go extremely wrong if not cured promptly. Thank you When she was fighting the Lyme Disease. En Español! Esta es Patricia Almeida y es una luchadora. Esta es mi abuela. Actualmente es una enfermedad de Lyme y Brest Cancer y se está recuperando de una cirugía de espalda intensa que involucra su disco L5 en la columna vertebral. Tenía fuertes dolores en las piernas y el médico le dijo que si podían afeitarse el disco, aliviarían la presión y el dolor. Ella tiene un 80% de probabilidad de mejorar. Nos enviaron a casa al día siguiente. Una vez que dejamos las carreteras en Corpus, estaban muy llenas de baches y le causaron un dolor desafortunado. Cuando regresamos a Laredo, la misma noche que mi abuela tenía que ir al Doctors Hospital en Laredo. Donde solo pudieron darle un medicamento para aliviar el dolor y la enviaron a casa. Al día siguiente, ella tiene fiebre y vómitos y necesitábamos asistir a la sala de emergencias de Laredo Medical Center. Donde nos dijeron que no podían hacer nada debido al procedimiento que se estaba realizando fuera de la ciudad. Así que nos vimos obligados a regresar a Corpus el día 5, donde el médico solo amplificó sus medicamentos. Y le dijo que volviera a casa y que si notara algo fuera o sintiera dolor al ir a la sala de emergencias. En nuestro camino a casa ella comenzó a experimentar el drenaje mientras se levantaba. Así que la llevamos al hospital por tercera vez. Y se les dijo que volvieran a Corpus para coserse y para que le vigilaran cualquier infección. Actualmente se encuentra en el Hospital Laredo a la espera de ser transportada a otro Hospital en Corpus. Le solicitamos ayuda para ayudarnos con los gastos médicos del transporte, las comidas y los medicamentos. Después de una tercera vez de tener que ir y venir de un hospital a otro, no siempre es asequible en emergencias como estas.  ¡Que Dios los bendiga a todos! Por favor envíe oraciones para una pronta recuperación. La columna vertebral y el cerebro son dos partes del cuerpo muy importantes y cualquier complicación puede ir muy mal si no se cura rápidamente.

And for complete creative control and efficient marketing & publishing, this venture comes at many costs.   The 21st century has paved the way for free thinkers, and a new found draw to sexual freedom and diversity. The forbidden arts of BDSM, has been a long-standing tradition that few have honored in its complete, positive light. This book unlocks the secrets and helps to right the stereotypes behind Dom/Sub dynamics. Many of the techniques and forms of BDSM, are shown through the growth of a young man, who embarks on a quest for love, orgasmic freedom and happiness in mind, body and soul. But this freedom doesn’t come at an easy cost, as tragedy, failures and love quarrels fill his reality. Explore the depths of sexual enticement and prepare to be punished.  I have studied BDSM and it’s arts for many years. Traveling the world and simply engaging in those forbidden, adult behaviors, and through my education, has opened my eyes to a deeper knowledge of the arts. Yet many still only know of through Hollywood and it’s rise in popularity amongst their peers.  I want to teach and educate through a unique story taken from real accounts in my life and others.

More recently, however, my dental situation has finally spiraled out of control to a point where I'm living with pain every single day, with little to no respite. At all. I've attempted to solve this through at work insurance, paying out of pocket just to get what was needed done, and even going to Mexico to help find cheaper rates. The truth is, that I can't seem to do this alone. I'm going to try my hardest as I can, because I cannot deal with this forever, and it's just going to keep getting worse if I wait. But I need help. The money raised will cover the individual procedures, the travel expenses, and so on to help get things going. I have found a dentist that is willing to work with me on paying him, as necessary, but he is in Mexico, and I'll be needing to both travel to him, and bring a translator. However, his work is the cheapest, and he actually is sure he can fix my front teeth with permanent full teeth. No dentures, no weird extensions, no braces. I'll be using the funds as they come in to get little bits done here, and there. The first hurtle is $1000, which I am a little short of on my own, but I hope to have it soon. This will cover the root canals and crowns in the problem areas where I'm feeling pain, as both the doctor and I feel that this is the most necessary place to start. Anything helps. Seriously.

I have been mentioning this post for about a week, but it has been on my mind for months, and I am really happy to share it with you all.  As part of my travels here in Southeast Asia, I have decided to give back to the community in a way that can only happen with the collaboration of everyone in my online community! I need every bit of help that I can get. Upon touching down in Thailand, I took to the streets to ask locals in the community about charitable causes that they believed in that could use a little bit of help. After a couple of dead ends, and language barriers, I have landed my sights on an organization in Chiang Mai, Thailand, called Agape Home, which is an organization that helps children and families that are still dealing with the affects of HIV/AIDS. In many cases, the one or both of the parents of these children have passed away due to the often fatal illnesses.  Agape home works with these children, these families, and placement families to make sure that the children who are born with HIV have the medications they need to live a healthy and full life, while also assisting their parents with their illness, and providing the children with homes that have been most affected by the disease. So I am asking for your donations. This isn’t an organization, this isn’t a ploy for money, and this isn’t a gimmick. This is me, Taylor Potter, following my heart, and giving back to a community of people who have given so much for others, who have amazingly large hearts and souls, and can are far less fortunate than most American I have ever known, but far far happier as well. BUT, I am not willing to ask people to give without giving something in return, so I have worked long and tirelessly to come up with a way to reach as many people as possible, and maintain a personal relationship with the goal. Here is something to keep in mind, plus, an added bonus on top of feeling charitable and knowing that you have helped me do something that means alot to me, and this community. Share with no money= Thank you photo or video. $1 Donation: A personalize thank you photo or video from where I am.  $5 donation: Post card from where I am sent when I get home + Thank you Video $10 donation: Post card sent to you from nearest PO +Thank you Video $20 Donation: Post card AND gift from me where I am sent when I get home + Thank you Video Do you enjoy photos of my travel? Do you think I should get paid to write my blogs? Do you follow me on instagram when you need a pickup? Have I ever helped you without asking for anything in return? Do you really truly love and care about me? Are you a person reading this? If any of the following is true, please, donate. Or, if you don’t have money, share this post. If you don’t want to share the post, tell somebody about it. Anyone at all. For those who didn’t know, the minimum wage in Thailand is $10 US PER DAY! Not per hour, PER DAY! So while $10 doesn’t sound like a huge deal, it makes a big difference, and a little bit of love goes a long way.  Thank You all, from the very bottom of my heart!

I am a fellow Knight of Peter Claver and dear friend of the two men I would like to introduce to you.  Please take a minute to hear my story about these two dear, wonderful men and elder knights at my church.   We are the Knights of Peter Claver and Ladies Auxiliary Council 6 at St. Rose de Lima Catholic Church in Bay St. Louis, MS.  We would like to introduce you to Knights Paul Jordan Sr. and Jack Schornick. Both are wonderful men with true faith and courage.  Although they both are knights, only Jack could hit the notes to sing in the choir.  They assist in many ways as knights in Unit 6 of the KPCLA as well as here in Bay St. Louis.  Paul and Jack work tirelessly in, around, and for all of St. Rose Catholic Church.  They serve tirelessly; one as an usher and the other in the choir.  If there is work to be done to, in, and for the church and the community, they are your go-to guys for sure.  As a Catholic organization along with the church and friends, we are enlisting your assistance in helping Paul and Jack financially during their upcoming  . Your assistance is much-needed and is truly urgent.    Knight Jordan has been in kidney failure for the past few years.  He has stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease, (CKD), and in dire need of a transplant.  As God would have it, he needed to look no further than the choir and to his fellow knight to find an acceptable donor; his friend Jack.  Jack’s courageousness in donating a kidney to Paul was truly a God sent miracle and a totally selfless act to help a friend sustain life. We are asking for your donations, no matter how small, to assist in offsetting the costs associated with the surgery and post-surgical needs for them.  ALL donations given will go towards their medical and personal needs involved with the transplant.  Although insurance is involved there will certainly be medical and personal costs over and above what is covered.  As they are proud men, at times we as the church and the community have to take up our brother’s cross when they can no longer carry it for themselves.    Our brothers’ kidney transplant surgery is set for   at Tulane University hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Although their friendship has been long, this is only the beginning of their medical journey together.  I would ask you to look in the recesses of your mind and the depths of your heart to assist us in our brothers' medical endeavors. We would like for you to donate and be a part of their story. When Paul and Jack look back on all the people they knew that helped them, they will be able to smile and tell a story of how perfect strangers played a significant part in their lives.  In Paul's case, being alive.    As of today, we have raised   in our financial quest.  We are attempting to raise   by  .  March 6th is Ash Wednesday.  We felt this would be a wonderful time to conclude our brothers work and start in prayer for them and others.  Noting this was a most holy day for Catholics and those of other faiths, the first day of the Lenten season would start a new chapter in Paul and Jack's lives both spiritually and physically.   Along with your donations we would also appreciate you sending your love and prayers to these fine gentlemen.  Will you assist us?  I know with your help and kindness we will certainly reach our goal.  Along with thanking you for your donations, I will also update you on their post-surgical progress.  I am sure with these two I will have a funny story to tell....""on the way to the kidney transplant""....... :-)   Thank you for your time, consideration, prayers and donations.

Featuring a large outdoor rink, a community hall, a change shack, a Zamboni, and most importantly, a dedicated team of volunteers, this outdoor rink continues to maintain a natural ice surface and welcoming facilities that are unparalleled in our region. This year, we will require new shingles for our two buildings and repairs to the play structure. We are calling upon friends in our area who use the rink and its facilities, as well as folks from farther afield who can appreciate the smiles on kids' faces as they stick-handle Bobby Orr-style in a game of pickup shinny.  Your contributions will help us purchase the materials we need to maintain what we have built, while relying upon volunteer labour to do the work. If we fail to meet our fundraising target by July 1st, 2019, or if we (hopefully) exceed our target, we will provide you with the option of leaving your donation with us, or receiving a full or partial refund. Regardless of the outcome, we will keep you apprised of our progress, and provide you with these options. Our community rink is many things to many people.

184,https://www.gofundme.com/f/jorge-pichardo-lend-a-helping-hand,Jorge Pichardo- Lend a helping Hand!,"Jorge Pichardo is a 2014 Harvard High School Graduate.  He graduated in the top 50% of his class with a 3.6 GPA.  In high school, he made it to State several times for cross country and track. He holds two school records and was inducted into the Athletes Hall of Fame.  He is currently attending Viterbo University located in LaCrosse, WI. He also holds some records there and qualified for a national meet in cross county this past fall. Here is his story: “Where do I even start? I’ve come to the point in my life where I do not know what to do anymore. I don’t think there has not been one day that I don’t stress about something. As much as it hurts for me to say this, all of this started after the separation of my parents. I’ve tried to be a big boy about it, but deep down, it still hurts. My parents are not to blame for anything. Whatever happened between them, happened. Things happen for a reason and that is perfectly okay. I love them both very much, and they have been there for me no matter what. A lot has changed since then and it really sucks. I’ve let it damage myself, my school work, and running. I’ve done everything I can to not think about it, but sometimes I can’t control it. I think about it and it destroys me. I am very good at hiding everything, and that’s just because I don’t want people to worry about me. Ever since then, the financial struggle has always been there. However, I am to blame for that. I’ve made decisions that I thought were good for myself, but honestly, I really don’t know what I was thinking. It may be different for some, but the student-athlete life has been really hard for me. Going to school, going to practices/meets, and working has not been easy. I barely worked and whatever I made, it would go toward bills that I needed to pay off. Like I said, I am to blame for all that. I thought I could afford a nice car during college, but in reality, I couldn’t. I barely made the payments for it. I took the easy way out, and took out extra loans and credit cards to help myself out. It still wasn’t enough. Those extra loans were not just for me, but were also to help out my family with anything they needed. I used them to help pay for bills at the house. I didn’t care how much I had to take out because I knew I had to repay them back when I graduated and that was perfectly okay with me. My family means the world to me. I didn’t care how much debt I put myself in, as long as I was helping out them out, I was perfectly okay with it.  I’m not going to lie, but it’s gotten so bad that I’ve tried killing myself several times. I know that’s something no one wants to hear, but I just want to be honest. I get so stressed about this that sometimes, I just don’t want to live anymore. It really sucks feeling like this. I will never do that though. It won’t solve anything, the only thing it will do is hurt others and I don’t want that.  I’ve made school and running my main priorities, but it shouldn’t have been like that. I should have focused on working and that is why I made the decision of not going back to school. Another reason why I am doing this is because last night was a wakeup call, my car got repossessed. I am embarrassed about this, but it is what it is. I screwed up and now I have to fix this. This is one of the hardest decisions I have ever made because I’m not only leaving school, but I’m leaving the sport that I love as well. It breaks my heart to do this, but sometimes you have to sacrifice the things you love for your own good. I’m tired of being broke all the time and feeling like I don’t contribute to my family, but that’s on me. I’ve made stupid decisions and now I have to face the consequences. I’ve always made it seem like everything was going well, and that I was going to succeed. In reality, I don’t know what I’m doing and everything is the opposite. I feel like the whole world is on me and I don’t know how to get back up.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I am so sorry for letting you down.”",1547107200,20000,9,0,https://images.gofundme.com/HsIDhzw3-ySaeHQ-UnoGnP_x6SM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36088920_1547143041927124_r.jpeg,,545,a man holding a tennis racquet on a tennis court .,nan,

Eli loved airplanes so much that we were going to surprise him on his birthday on the 28th of this month to take him on a helicopter ride over the Hoover Dam which is near the border of Neveda and Arizona but, he passed away too soon. So, we want to be able to at least give him this space. There is only one left at Davis Funeral Home which we feel like is destined and is the right thing to send him off with. He was a really good kid. As far as pricing, Davis Funeral Home is requesting 20,000 for the coffin, viewing and the vault. But since we put the gofundme at 8,000, we feel as though we should keep it as is until we can reach that goal first. We are currently receiving outside help from family as well. We will keep you all updated on our goals but please share the go fund me out, and thank you to those who have supported so far. We can't do this without your help.  _______ This is Raquel, sister of Elias Collins. I'm speaking on behalf of my family because it's been very hard for them.  My baby brother was found dead in his room. My mother had to kick open his door in order to get to him. We don't know the cause of death, the EMT said that he suddenly fell dead and that it could've been a heart attack because there was no signs of anything that could've caused him to die otherwise. We are waiting to get autopsy results.   We would like to have a proper funeral for him and are hoping to get him into a vault in Las Vegas. We are contacting a few places that offer vaults and are waiting to see how much everything would cost but for now we have set our goal to $8000 since most vaults in Las Vegas cost around that price. We would all appreciate anything you could help with, anything to put him in a safe place for us to visit him. Thank you.     Elias was very sweet, kind and had the purest soul. Rest in peace baby brother. We love you so much.

Dr. Torres has been successfully running Rescue Mission Roatan since 2011 where he takes a multi-disciplinary team consisting of surgeons, anesthesiologists, CRNAs, operating room nurses, ICU nurses, medical students, and a paramedic from UMass. This team visits Hospital Roatan, a public hospital which is served by eleven physicians and is the only 24-hour emergency center on the surrounding islands. The week-long mission begins with triaging and scheduling the operations for the rest of the week. There are 2 operating rooms with limited equipment which over the years have been continuously contributed to by Dr. Torres’ teams to help the sustainability and care that the surgeon at Hospital Roatan can provide to the patients. It is with this help that they have doubled the hospital’s operating capacity. Other activities and educational experiences include teaching TEAM (Trauma Evaluation and Management) and other simulations for hospital staff, providing postoperative care, and coordinating and overseeing small group exercises. The experience of Rescue Mission Roatan leaves a long-lasting impression on the team of the determination and strength of the Honduran people as well as teaching them the effort and organization that goes into leading and participating in a mission like this that offers such great rewards. We are looking for donations to help support the ongoing need at Hospital Roatan which serves the underserved population of  Honduras and those from surrounding islands. Donations will help to support the sustainability of this mission both now and in the future. The  money raised will be used for surgical supplies and equipment, storage costs, travel and accommodation for our multidisciplinary team etc. Any and all donations will provide a tremendous impact on the underserved populations we seek to assist.

207,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-wesson-get-to-ohio,Help Deja & Kyle get Wesson to Ohio!,"SHORT VERSION: Wesson is the 21st medical case where a child has both volvulus and Hirschsprungs Disease, causing him to spend his first four months of life in the NICU [where the two older siblings weren’t allowed in to see him for two full months], followed by multiple hospital admissions.  Deja was diagnosed with an unknown fetal mass at 5 months pregnant and had to wait until she delivered to see what it was. First surgery at ten hours old, ended up being malrotation and volvulus. His intestine had twisted while in the womb, part of it dying off. Surgeon brought a piece of intestine to the outside of his body to allow him to poop in a bag and created a mucous fistula where mucous would drain into another bag. Wesson had to pass poop into his diaper before he would be able to get the surgery to put him back together. For some reason, at 7 weeks old, he was given the surgery to reattach his intestines even though he had never pooped. Once put back together, he got really sick. He had been misdiagnosed. There were red flags that proved the second surgery to put him together never should have happened. Two weeks after that surgery, he was taken back for his third surgery to take apart the previous surgery, recreating the stoma and mucous fistula. He was diagnosed with Hirschsprungs Disease [ganglion cells tell our body when and how to pass poop but he’s missing those cells, rendering him unable to pass stool himself.] With such little healthy bowel left, he was also diagnosed with Short Gut Syndrome. Looking back he should have had one surgery but he left the NICU at four months old having had five surgeries. He went home with a central line [kind of like a permanent IV-its inserted through his chest and runs to a large vein near his heart to administer necessary nutrients he can’t get through food] , a g-tube [a tube placed directly into his stomach to feed him breast milk through a pump], an ostomy bag and a mucous fistula bag. Once home, he had some progression early on but has been mostly stagnant in his growth due to the fact he’s been throwing up his own poop for four months and his doctors ultimately still aren’t sure how to treat him. This has resulted in Wesson throwing up large amounts of his poop every 6-9 days, continued weight loss, less breast milk intake, lack of progression. It is imperative he continue to grow because the less his body is able to do on his own, the more help he needs, the more at risk he is for needing a liver and intestine transplant which is Deja and Kyle’s worst fear during all of this as it will greatly reduce Wesson’s quality of life and his chance at living a long, healthy life. Wesson can be seen by the best doctors for his case but they are located in Ohio. Kyle is a Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, posing a challenge for them to get the proper care Wesson so desperately needs. Funds raised will be to help the family travel to and from Ohio over the next few years while they seek answers and the best care in the nation for Wesson. **Please read the disclaimer at the bottom regarding their other GoFundMe page** LONG VERSION: I’ll try to sum this up as informative as possible while keeping it quick and to the point. When Deja was 5 months pregnant, she got news of an abnormal anatomy scan. A mass was detected and she began seeing the maternal fetal specialist weekly. After multiple ultrasounds and a fetal MRI, the doctors were unable to tell what the mass was. That was the beginning of the “wait and see what happens” mindset she faced throughout her entire pregnancy and is still facing now, over a year later. Deja was induced on February 16th. Deja, Kyle, their other two children, Remington-5 and Colton-3, were able to spend two hours with Wesson before he was taken to the NICU. [This would be the last time their family would be all together for two months as it was flu season so Remi and Colt weren't allowed in the NICU until the season passed. Two whole months. Imagine the reality of what that meant for their family.] They still couldn’t figure it out so they had to operate on him at ten hours old to see what was going on. His intestine had twisted, causing a part of it to die off which had to be removed. The surgeon created a stoma for Wesson to pass poop through into a bag along with a mucous fistula where fluid would drain from his bowel into a separate bag. Wesson would stay in the NICU for 6-8 weeks while his intestines healed well enough to be reattached then they’d be sent home and this would all be behind them. Or so they thought. Wesson had one goal he had to meet before the reconnection surgery-pass poop into his diaper. To do that, they would withdraw poop from his ostomy bag and insert a tube into his fistula where the poop would be slowly pumped into his bowel. The goal-get intestines to respond and pass poop normally. Not only did he never poop, those refeeds kept spilling out. Looking back, Kyle and Deja see what a mistake it was to move forward with the reconnection surgery although at the time they had no idea there could be something else going on nor did any doctors voice concern. The reconnection surgery should have never happened but somehow a team of doctors all came to the conclusion that it should, regardless of the lack of necessary progress. Within a few days of his surgery, Wesson became extremely distended and was throwing up large amounts of different colored green bile. After a rectal biopsy, where he bled so badly he needed a blood transfusion, it was determined Wesson has Hirschsprungs Disease and because he has such little healthy bowel left, he also has Short Gut Syndrome. The surgeon was very concerned what this meant for Wesson’s ability to grow and his quality of life. They were told to be prepared for the possibility of liver and intestinal transplants, allowing them a few years at a time before Wesson would go into organ failure, requiring another transplant every so many years. Exactly two weeks after his second surgery, he was wheeled back for his third surgery-to take apart what they had just reconnected. That was the worst for Kyle and Deja as they dug deep into research and knew how important that surgery was. Our family gathered at Fisher House while Wesson went back for five hours. The surgeon anticipated only 15 cm of healthy intestine which would present many challenges. Halfway through the surgery, the nurse called and handed the phone to the surgeon who, with a wave of relief in his voice, told Kyle and Deja they found 93 cm of healthy intestine! An absolute miracle and answered prayer. This meant Wesson had a fighting chance at a normal-ish life. Wesson was intubated [breathing tube down his throat] for days after this surgery and when they went to take the tube out, he had a rare reaction [Dr. said it happens maybe twice a year] where his vocal cords were swollen and he was unable to breathe on his own. While a nurse calmly and steadily pumped an oxygen bag to keep him alive, all sorts of teams went running into the NICU to get him intubated again. There were a lot of scary moments during Wesson’s journey but that one made Kyle and Deja realize how high the stakes really are. What this all ended up meaning was Wesson would be unable to maintain nutrition on his own. He would need a g-tube placed in his stomach where breast milk would go directly into his stomach. Deja never had the chance to breastfeed him at all as every bit that went in had to be measured. She was so excited for him to be put back together so she could nurse him like she has her other two babies but unfortunately she would never get the chance.  He would also need a Broviac, which is a central line, placed in his chest to deliver all the nutrients he can’t get through food. Those nutrients are called TPN-Total Parenteral Nutrition. The downside with that is the lipid [fats] damage his liver over time. How long Wesson is dependent on TPN more than breast milk and eventually food, will determine his quality of life and his ability to avoid transplants. The goal is to get him up on his milk feeds and down on his TPN  AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. After four months in the NICU, Wesson was able to go home with his family and begin living a normal life filled with a ton of appointments and lots of adventures. Fast forward to now, one week before Wesson’s first birthday. Wesson was making great progress his first few months out of the NICU. Going up in breast milk, gaining weight, TPN going down. Everything was going well until August. He got to 23ml of milk per hour through his g-tube but his output [poop] wasn’t slowing down so his feeds sat at 23 ml/hr for a few months. In November, Wesson began throwing up his poop. Yes, his own poop coming out of his mouth. This is a huge red flag for kids like Wesson. He has also been admitted to the hospital five times over the last eight months, three of the stays being during December [one stay over Christmas but thankfully Santa visits the hospital too so they could still celebrate as a family, even if stuck in a hospital room] and January, one stay specifically for the fact he was throwing up his poop. During all of these stays, Deja was pressing doctors and the surgery team for answers, ideas, a plan of treatment. For four months now, Wesson has been consistently throwing up his own poop every 6-9 days and the doctors still have no idea what is going on. In the meantime, Wesson went from 23ml/hr of milk down to 5ml/hr. Breast milk is vital to get him to the point of progress but he cannot grow or get better at such a low rate of milk. It’s constant steps backwards and no answers or urgency to get Wesson the help he needs. His doctors have suggested multiple possible causes but all have been ruled out. Deja fought insurance for five months to get Wessons cares transferred to Rady’s to see a doctor there that actually specializes in Hirschsprungs but after the referral finally went through, the doctors first available appointment was still three months away. An eight month process just for a second opinion. At this point, they don’t have that kind of time to waste anymore. The longer Wesson is unable to digest his food properly, the higher risk of needing a transplant. USE OF DONATIONS: While Wesson was in the NICU, Deja reached out to a world-renowned doctor who specializes in colorectal and pelvic reconstruction surgery. Within a few hours he was calling Deja to offer advice and support. This doctor helped to create one of the very first centers where all necessary teams are present to treat kids like Wesson. People travel from all over the world to be seen here. This is the absolute best place Wesson can be and the best care he can get. Out of desperation after another poop throw up, Deja reached out to this doctor again at 1:30 am via email and within 4 hours, this doctor, who doesn’t even have Wesson as a patient,  responded asking if they can get Wesson to see him as “he needs a devoted colorectal center with expertise in hirschsprung surgery. This involves surgeons, not only GI docs.” They already wanted Wesson to be seen there but the fact this doctor-clearly a busy man-cares enough about patients that aren’t even his to almost immediately hop on a phone call and then email her back so fast shows his character and desire to truly help their family. The only catch-they are located at Nationwide Childrens in Columbus, Ohio, while Deja and her family live in San Diego. They will do anything to get him seen there as often as needed to get Wesson in the right hands and they already regret not getting him there earlier. Deja will likely make the trips alone often but their family has spent so much time apart over this last year. Four months in the NICU, back to back to back hospital stays, Kyle sent away to help protect the border. While the whole family won’t go together every single time, the kids would benefit greatly to be together as much as possible especially during long stays, such as surgeries. Remington and Colton have sacrificed so much and are so resilient but they start to miss their momma and baby brother and shouldn’t have to continue to be separated during these trying times. Any money raised will go toward facilitating travel to and from Ohio, a rental car, possibly a hotel if the Ronald McDonald house is filled up, food, any traveling expenses.

214,https://www.gofundme.com/f/6unqx80,Sophia’s Journey,"Sophia is my full of life amazing 16yr old daughter. She is beautiful, brave, smart and sassy. She also has Rett Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder seen *almost exclusively in females.  It is as prevalent as ALS, Cystic Fibrosis, and Huntington's disease, yet so many people have never heard of it! Sophia was born “normal” and healthy, meeting most of her milestones until she was a toddler. Then suddenly, almost overnight, her world turned upside down and she lost all of her language, functions, and skills. Sophia no longer walks, talks, eats by mouth, nor has purposeful hand use.  She has had dozens of surgeries, including a spinal fusion, gallbladder removal, multiple ports, and a VNS. Sophia takes multiple medications, multiple times a day. Additionally she has a VNS implant to help control seizures.  All that combined, she still seizes daily. As if Rett wasn’t “enough” to contend with, Sophia was diagnosed with CVID (Common variable immunodeficiency) in 2013. CVID is a disorder characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins (antibodies) and an increased susceptibility to infections. Basically, Sophia's doesn't have very much of an immune system, and there's no known reason, cause or cure. She is at a high risk of illnesses and infections. We are treating this as best we can with regular IVIG infusions, (AKA her Super Powers). Sophia receives these infusion in the Special Procedure Area (SPA) of University of Chicago Hospital. She currently goes every 12 days for her infusions, each lasting 5-6 hours to administer.  Through the years we have made hundreds of trips to the ER, only to be admitted for treatment and care.  Her respiratory system is fragile, compromised, and generally weak.  Her immune system nearly nonexistent. When she is not in the hospital, she is going to the hospital for treatments or care.  In our day to day life we do all we can to not expose Sophia to anyone who is sick. Catching even a simple cold will most likely turn into pneumonia, and an extended PICU stay.   She has been though more in her young life then most people will endure in their lifetime. Yet she handles it all with dignity and grace; seldom shedding a tear. She has THE most amazing beautiful smile... It can light up even the darkest days.  Her eyes speak the words I can no longer hear her say.She is strong. She is brave.She needs my help, and I need yours...As Sophia's mom, the three hardest words for me to say are: I Need Help.Yet here I am. Sophia holds a special place in so many hearts... So often, people ask us what they can do to help Sophia, and make her life brighter.  As her mom, I feel I should be able to provide everything for her, so I struggle with this. However, a new need has become overwhelmingly apparent in recent months. We are in need of a new wheelchair accessible van for Sophia.Sophia's trips back and forth to the hospital are vital to her care and well being.  When she is healthy and stable she typically has 6-7 appointments at the hospital every month, with an hour drive each way. 4 years ago we purchased a used 2002 E150 Ford Full Size Conversion. In the past year we have encountered multiple extremely expensive problems with it. Sadly, it’s time to cut our loss and trade it in. With the help of our family, and some creative financing, we have managed to come up with most of the funds needed to purchase a new van, with a brand-new *manual (nothing to break) conversion. We are soooo close, but need your help. This is the ONLY way I can take Sophia to the hospital and get the infusions she so desperately needs to simply Survive. Admitidly, I'm afraid of what will happen if the van dies, or needs more repairs before I can get her a new one. There's SO much she can't do, but she did so much joy in the simplest things. Watching her brother play football, visiting the coffee shop, and going for a drive on a sunny day to name a few. I humbly ask you to support our fundraiser to provide New Wheels for Sophia.  Please share our story and invite your friends and family to do so, too. And if it's in your heart (and checkbook) please donate.  We need your help.New Wheels for Sophia will:1. Allow Sophia to continue to receive her Super Powers (IVIG) every 10 day as well as all her other regular doctor appointments.  2. Allow Sophia to get out and enjoy the world with her family!3. Prevent Mama from being injured due to heavy lifting of Sophia and the wheelchair.What do you say? Will you help us get Sophia on the road? She's got a lot of living to do!!With heartfel appercaition,MimiAny funds raised over the amount needed to complete this purchase will be used specifically for her trips to the hospital.

Toffee was sent home with an expensive list of pain killers to assist in keeping her as comfortable as possible.  Today mum called me with the news that toffee had deteriorated overnight and went to the vet again this morning.  Toffee has now been admitted into the Lort Smith animal hospital in Melbourne where she is now confined to an oxygen chamber in hopes that this will be our chance to save her or at least give us a little more time with our best friend as we’re not ready to say goodbye.

Who we are trying to reach: We are humbly asking any friends, family, supports of Christian Union to consider donating money to pay for our mid year camp registration for students who are financially stressed. You might have been part of our club as a student, or know someone who is in our club, or just heard about our work on campus and love the mission! How the funds will be spent: All donations will go towards student subsidies. We have 3 accommodation options for our mid year conference (camping, cabin and lodge). The money will allow for a discount registration price for students who require financial assistance to pay for their conference ticket camping or cabin accommodation. Each subsidy is unique to the student's needs. Withdrawal plan: Our club Christian Union has paid the entire conference fees for all students requiring financial assistance direct to the venue Belgrave Heights Convention. Each student has been notified about the discount they will receive and has paid the subsidied conference fee to Christian Union. The withdrawn money from the go fund me page therefore will go directly to reimburse Christian Union in their bank account.  Summit is Melbourne University Christian Union's big mid-year conference! Together we spend 5 days praising God, hearing his word, making new friends and deepening existing friendships. This year the theme is Worship and the Spirit! In 2018 we had 115 students come to Summit, including students from Christian Union at Australian Catholic University, Graduate Christian Union and our international group FOCUS. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to keep costs at a minimum, money can be barrier to students coming.

Entropion is an eye disorder that commonly affects potbellied pigs and is where the eyelashes curl into the eyeball, which can cause ulceration and eventually blindness, not to mention pain. Meet Pearl @thepigpearl on Instagram.  It is more common when a pig is overweight, so as many of you who know Pearl have heard, she has been on a diet for months under the guidance of her amazing vet, Dr. Blake Miller. Unfortunately, she was not severely overweight, so losing weight did not help much. Fortunately, there is a surgery that can correct the Entropian.  Entropion interferes with eyesight, so Pearl is probably both uncomfortable and unable to see well. This makes her jumpy and uneasy about being touched. It has made it much more difficult for the world to fully love and appreciate Pearl because she is too frightened and nervous on our walks about the neighborhood, to be loved on by strangers. Pearl has changed me and my family forever. We no longer see pigs as food. She has taught me patience in a way I've never known. She's tenacious, headstrong and adorable. I know she has made a difference in the lives of many others in the world with her antics and personality when people meet her in person, and when you all see her photos and videos on Instagram. I rarely ask for help for myself, but if you can help me, help Pearl, I’d really appreciate it.  Dr. Miller has an opening for surgery on February 7, if we can raise the funds.

Josh fights everyday to overcome every mountain in his way, and now he needs a little help with his next hurdle. Josh is unable to walk any kind of long distances, this means that he cannot walk around places like the mall, zoo, park, museum and many other places kids love to go. When Josh has a hemiplegic or dystonia crisis he is unable to move his body, sometimes for days at a time!  For years we have used a manual wheelchair to help Josh, but this deprives Josh of any form of autonomy to move himself around. After a year of deciding, and progression of his disease, the time has come to move him to a power wheelchair. With this change we will finally need to purchase a wheelchair accessible van. To date we have always manually lifted his chair into and out of the car which is just not doable anymore. We have a few funding options to help with the finanaical burden but need to clean up with the remaining $20,000 by the end of February when his new chair will arrive.

She is mother to 7, two of which were dependent on her for living expenses.  We realize all of our lives will now be changed, but in the immediate timeframe we have identified a few things that we just cannot do by ourselves. 1) Financial upkeep of our mom's house while she is incapacitated.  These costs are solely related to utilities, space rental, and other ""house-specific"" costs. (Estimated at $1,500/month with donation request for 3 months @ $4,500.) 2) The immediate costs associated with travel from various locations across the country (California, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana).  These costs include hotels, transportation to/from the hospital, and lost wages from time required to take off from work.  (Donations will NOT be used for frivolous things like nice restaurants or high-end hotels.  The goal here is for somebody to be available for our mother to assist in her needs until she can leave the hospital(s).) 3) The eventual need to settle our mother's medical costs.  These costs will include all fees over/beyond what is covered under her medical insurance (i.e. life-flight). These costs are now unknown and may require an update to our financial goal.

As a government contractor, my company allowed us to use borrowed PTO to help during the first couple of weeks during the shutdown. I have now exhausted all allotted PTO for the next year. This really sucks because I will have a newborn baby who will need me to take him to doctors appointments and care for him if he becomes ill, but I will no long have the PTO to do that.  I am now on leave   from my company until the government reopens. I received my last full paycheck on the 4th of January.  I will also be on leave without pay for 2 additional months after giving birth to our son in March due having to exhaust my PTO. Our savings for maternity leave is now nonexistent because of the financial struggles we are currently facing. My husband and I are trying to get by on his paycheck alone and will not be able to pay our bills; in particular our mortgage and our car note.  The media focuses on the 800,000 federal employees who are without pay during the shutdown, however it seldom mentions the government contractors who are also affected. Contractors have no hopes of back pay from the government, which means it will be even harder for us to get back on our feet once the shutdown has ended. Some creditors are offering a temporary forbearance that grants you up to a month with no payment. However once the shutdown ends, you are responsible for your payments and any payments missed within 30 days. This is just not feasible for those of us who are not expecting back pay.  I have put out countless applications, but I must admit that finding a new job at 7 months pregnant is no easy feat. Pregnancy is stressful enough as it is, without the added worry of whether or not I'll have the means to provide for my baby once he is here or how I will afford the medical bills. My financial security has been ripped from me and my family because our elected officials are unaware of how to be good leaders. Those of us who are affected should not have to suffer because of this.  We are currently looking into options that will help us scrape by... we have already called all of our creditors in hopes of assistance, but their hands are tied for the most part. This is  a huge blow to not only our credit, but also to our livelihood and morale. In a time where I should be rejoicing over the fact that I will soon be welcoming  a new addition to our family, I am overwhelmed by stress and dread for the future.

251,https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-need-of-help-asking-for-help,"In need of help, asking for help.","First I want to start off by saying this is the  hardest thing to do at this point in my life. I don't want to put my life story out for others to feel sorry or sad for me. Life may seem like peaches and cream via social media but in reality that's not always true. I've endured so many hardships throughout my life. This is especially since I moved here to Colorado in 2005; from car accidents to cancer to unemployment and more. Never did I think that I would get to this point to create a GoFundMe page. But I thought it would be a good start rather than standing outside at an intersection with a sign. A little secret about me, in 2012, I did stand outside for 2 hours at an intersection while I was going through radiation therapy. I don't want to have to go down to that point again. Unfortunately on November 9th 2018, I was let go of my position. Truthfully, I was falsely accused of saying something I did not say. I was not asked for my side of the story, nothing. I was devastated as I loved my job. I have been searching for employment aggressively since then. Also, I have reached out to every available resource possible for help. I am getting energy, food and medical assistance. But there are other financial responsibilities that I cannot get help for from the county like gas for my car, making sure my car is insured as well as my car payment, etc. I did apply for a debt consolidation loan and it gave me enough to take care of my bills for the month of December as well as help for my rent this month. I wasn't able to get approved for any more. The next option I have is to do a cash advance off of my Discover card which I am really trying to avoid. And the amount that I can get will not be enough to hold me through of what I currently need help with. For the past 6 or so months, I've been going through a lot of pain and discomfort due to my lower back. I've endured so much pain throughout the years, I've done pretty well at hiding it. But lately, the pain is intense and at times physically draining. I can't do any type of narcotic for pain relief other than a muscle relaxer here and there which I prefer not to. This has been affecting me to the point where I can barely stand for up to 10 minutes at a time, can barely make it walking 200 feet and I can't sit for very long. I was finally able to get a bilateral L5 TFESI on New Year's Eve. The problems with steroid injections is either they can start working right away, it can take up to 7 to 14 days to start working or you may not notice really any change in relief. Right now I'm not feeling any type of relief which really sucks and affects my day-to-day life. I've always had lower back discomfort but ever since my head on collision in 2016, my lower back pain and problems has literally gone downhill since then. I was also diagnosed with mild neurocognitive disorder after that accident as well as increased migraines. I  have been donating plasma even though I'm actually not supposed to being a breast cancer survivor as well as being on a couple of medications. It doesn't affect my plasma, it affects me physically. Donating plasma twice a week is extremely draining and exhausting. I don't know what else to do or where else to go as I've researched everything possible, contacted many organizations and so on. I am waiting on my settlement from my car accident in 2016. It won't be much but it's better than nothing. I'm even willing to right, sign with notarization to pay back any funds donated or loaned to me. This will be once I get my settlement in which I hope will be in the next couple of months. As far as Jobs go, I'm applying for jobs that aren't even within my job description or abilities. I have had several interviews. Some of the positions literally take up to 2 months just to even get a yes or no. I'm even signed up with a few temp agencies. I will be forever gratefulfor help in any denomination. You could also reach out to me personally via text, call or Facebook Messenger. I also have a Venmo account if that helps. Even if it's $5, that's money I can put in my gas tank to travel for job interviews, pick my son up from school, go to the grocery store and so on. And as I mentioned before, I am willing to do a promissory of repayment with it signed, dated and notarized if wanted. Thank you so much for taking the time out to read this. I tried to explain my situation in the easiest way possible even though this is very tough for me to do. I've always been a strong woman, stood up for myself, figured out a way to make ends me and so on. I'm very thankful and grateful for a friend who helped with Christmas and birthday for my son. Otherwise I would not have been able to provide that. Please feel free to share this with others as I would be forever grateful.",1547107200,1500,11,0,https://images.gofundme.com/4heaEJOUawat-4_tz_ItiWNNUvM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36088140_1547141212566443_r.jpeg,,130,a couple of women standing next to each other .,nan,
252,https://www.gofundme.com/f/y9hndj-help-for-tanner,Help for Tanner Schroeder,"Our sweet son Tanner has been fighting for a long time.  His mental illness issues started long before it became apparent to people outside of his family.  We watched as the anxiety and depression got worse, as he desperately read, researched, watched videos, etc - seeking a way to overcome his pain.  Over the last few years he has been in dozens of hospital E.R.'s, treatment facilities, many psych wards, etc.   And we've been along with him each time.    For years his mom Shannon and I have done everything in our power to help find Tanner a program that works.  With each new place we raise our hopes again, but each time takes a toll (financially, mentally, emotionally and spiritually).  The sad fact is that our mental health system is very broken, and it doesn't seem that treating or curing underlying issues are the core focus at all.  Indeed, paired with insurance companies, and complicit physicians, the system is designed to facilitate a financial revolving door of patients.  Open beds are increasingly harder to come by.  Those with money can pay for better programs, but often it takes a lot of trial and error to find pathways to treatment and cure that take hold.   For us the money went out the door consistently over the course of that last four years.   And there is none left. Thus far Tanner has become steadily worse.  His official diagnosis is BiPolar Disorder 1 with Dysphoric Mania and strong Schizoaffective features.  He sees demons doing unspeakable things to his loved ones, he has false beliefs about events in the past, he often is delusional and believes himself to be someone like Kurt Cobain or Elvis reincarnated.  His paranoia and fear are paralyzing.  All of this goes on in his poor head 24/7, for years, and he still keeps trying and seeking happiness.   That is all we want for him.  That he may find a place of peace again in this world.  Mental illness and it's effects on family, can be devastating.  It certainly has torn up our world.  But we keep trying and hoping.   At this point all of my resources have been taken by this process.  We were able to get Tanner into an excellent program last week but the remaining cost of it after insurance, and after I help the facility to find cost savings through healthcare group purchasing contracts and volunteer to work there free on various projects - is still approximately $50,000.   This is a six month program called Crownview Co-Occurring Institute in Oceanside, CA.     I believe that CrownView has the right plan to bring Tanner back to a place where he can come back to us functionally and enjoy the life he deserves. The money raised on this page will go to pay for his participation in the program.   If we can't raise it the likelihood of Tanner getting the help he needs is very low.  We've exhausted most options for him and he typically ends up on the street and gets picked up by police and taken to the psych ward.  There, they bombard him with anti-psychotic drugs that only ""zombify"" him and cause his healing process to start over from square one.  Insurance then kicks him out just as he begins to show stability and healing.  Thus he is booted back to a facility where he knows nobody and forced to begin again piecing his life and thinking back together through a fog of meds. So I am humbly asking for help.  Last week at the program the staff was saying that by now, with the serious issues he has, they would have assumed everyone would have given up on Tanner.  That was hard to hear but it reinforced in me that I need to do   to help this sweet beautiful boy.    If you know Tanner's spirit you understand how much of a shame it is that he isn't able to be out in the world sharing it. Tanner deserves to have a life of peace and to explore this world, to find love, to be happy.  All of us do.  His path has just been a lot harder than most.    We are determined that the difficulty will not be ultimately in vain.   Please help us to get our boy back.  Anything you can give will be forever appreciated! Thank you, Stan Schroeder Shannon and Ryley",1547107200,50000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/wTRdrEjpv73_AMYbOAA75DttJlY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36088128_1547662138829485_r.jpeg,,10310,a man in a suit and tie sitting at a table .,nan,

254,https://www.gofundme.com/f/carlasfamilycan,Help Carla's Family Rebuild What Was Taken,"I paid my rent on time. I even did jobs around the house like, taking out the trash for all tenants most of the time. When winter arrived I shoveled our walkways and applied salt. I was not compensated nor did I receive a rent reduction. He considered the shoveling as favors. I kept the landlords up to date on dangerous issues like, the pipe from the house that spilled water onto the sidewalk which caused a sheet of ice to form. Had someone gotten hurt they would have been liable for injuries. They never fixed it by the way. Upon move in, I paid first month's rent, last month's rent, and a month and a half's security. New landlord's took over the apartment but, I made sure to confirm that they had my last month's rent and my security deposit.  So, the last month comes around that I paid for.   I tell him I didn't know that that's only if I was moving out. The previous management told me that it was for the last month that's on my receipt.     Mind you, he's coming to me in the month that it's paid for as opposed to the month before. He eventually said I was right and offered to give me a new lease at the end of our conversation. He mentions that every year rent goes up and he will tell me 60 days in advance when it does. But my new lease was due in 29 days. So he was going to raise my rent after a new lease was written.  I let him know that last month isn't required and that I know my rights. I also mentioned that I do things around the house that I'm not required to do but I do them because I live there. He claimed he's a landlord that goes above and beyond for me, however; when I told him that it was freezing cold in my apartment he didn't do anything for two weeks. I brought it up again and he came by and dropped off window treatment for all of three windows. I had 10. He didn't put it up. He didn't make sure that it was enough.  I figured he spent my last months rent and that's why he was so upset that I wasn't basically paying him twice. so I asked where my security was. He told me two different banks in a span of a week. After 10 months of mental distress and unhealthy living conditions, I got evicted. I asked for my security deposit back. He says all of it was used for repairs but ignored me when I asked for documentation. I cleaned and painted before I left. He was turning off parts of my electricity. He took almost 2 months to fix the lack of heat in the winter. He refused to exterminate. Sent a notice to Quit saying I was disturbing tenants when I wasn't. Both he and his wife lied on me in court documents. He harrassed me with cameras he installed in the apartment building. He threatened to constantly make me pay for something. He somehow gained access to my apartment and would enter when I wasn't there.    That's only half of it. Finally after going to court multiple times because I withheld due to repairs, I didnt have the full amount they asked fo. at the last court date. I was evicted. I thought I would present my case and the judge would grant me an abatement but without the full amount they didnt want to hear my case. .   That was the beginning of how me and my kids became homeless.  I am on a waiting list.  Iam constantly making calls, searching for housing, applying and reaching out to landlords and checking back with places.     She had a stroke a couple years ago that made it difficult for her to work. She finally saved up enough to put in her paperwork since she would have to wait 3 months for her pension with no income. Its been 3 months and she has given me around $6,000. I would love to give her that back and then some.  She has worked all her life and has paid the black tax. Its not fair. When I get my benefits, I pay for the week but, overall she pays for every few days. I am beyond grateful for her sacrifice for me and her grandkids.  I was substitute teaching for a while but I stopped due to health issues in 2017. Now I am switching careers and seeking opportunities as a writer. I also have a business idea that I really want to focus on. I know that if I didnt have to spend most of my energy looking for housing and surviving that I could thrive and give back. I have 2 infants home and need childcare. If I did find a good place, I would need money for:  security (Update: Possibly will be provided by agency) to get the basic necessities for a new place to turn on utilities  transportation insurance (Update: We now have transportation, just need insurance) (Update:We have insurance) help paying for the room (Update: We are in stable shelter and no longer need funds for a hotel room) I maxed out my credit card paying for some nights. I would love to pay that.  Getting me kids hair fixed because I dont know how to do hair. (but if your near me and can do it for free, that's great) Update Add:  Daycare for 1 month until I qualify for subsidies My domain name back Replacing what my Ex landlord caused me to lose I want to get on my feet so I can work and build a business. With a business I can be independent and less dependent on the government.  2018 was my year to get my life together. I was working on my credit, switching careers, learning a new language, and trying to get more involved with my disabled daughters education. I was cleaning up my life mentally and physically. That was stolen from me and my kids. Our lives were put on hold and things we didn't need to experience again, we have.  Once I get on my feet I know I can soar. I plan on pursuing a law made that makes security deposit information more transparent for the tenant. Also, I will see if I can have it so that other counties can't deny you shelter just because your from another county.  Thank you for reading our situation, sharing, donating, or a combination.

Earlier this year, she went to the doctor and he mentioned that she needs urgent surgery as  the reason her knee is getting worse is because her hips have dislocated and she has been exerting pressure on her knee to help her walk better. The doctor suggested that they should have the hip replacement first and a few months after rehabilitation, proceed with the knee surgery. For years now she has been having trouble walking  because of her hip but as a family since finances have been tight, having surgery done just seemed near impossible . Now that we are  older and can at least chip in we would love it if  finally our mom can have the surgery she was meant to have years ago. As a family this amount is quite high for us to raise alone so for that reason we are hoping to raise some more from this platform as we also  seek alternative sources. Any amount would be greatly appreciated. The money for her surgery  is about 2 million in Kenyan shillings which equates to around $20,000  and the remaining  5000$ will go into medication and rehabilitation as advised by the doctor.

Jason was diagnosed with a Myxoid Liposarcoma in his right brachial plexus in 2011.  After radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery Jason was cancer free.  In 2015, the cancer returned.  Jason has been through many different treatments, most requiring him to travel out of state.  With all he has faced in the last 4 years, Jason still gives 110% to his family, his school and his community. The doctors feel they have exhausted all treatment options and have told Jason that he will need an amputation of his right arm and shoulder.  The doctors are optimistic that, after the amputation, Jason may be a good candidate for some sort of functional prosthetic that will allow for increased mobility.  In order for all of this to happen, there will be numerous trips and stays in Denver needed as Jason has surgery and works with the specialists.  Although this means Jason may be able to claim “cancer free” after the amputation, the realities and potential financial costs of it are overwhelming.

271,https://www.gofundme.com/f/havenshope,Haven's Hope,"Haven is a 2-year-old warrior princess. The past 12 months have proven to be a battle for survival and although Haven has emerged victorious she has not remained unscathed. In March 2018, a week after Haven turned one, she woke and was unable to move the right side of her body. We took her to the children's hospital where they ran numerous tests on her. They discovered that her haemoglobin level was 3 (critical). Her level was so low that the doctors were amazed that Haven was still alive. An MRI soon revealed that Haven had a suffered from a watershed stroke. This was a result of her haemoglobin level being so low that it had drastically reduced the oxygen to the brain. Tragically, the aftermath of her stroke has left Haven with hemiplegia dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Haven's bone marrow was then sent to a genetic clinic for testing. The results showed that Haven suffers from an extremely rare blood disorder known as Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA). This condition is caused by a mutated gene called RPS19. DBA is extremely rare with approximately 800 people in the world that have it. Although there are medical treatments available for those suffering from DBA, there is, unfortunately, no official cure for it.  DBA is classed as bone marrow failure which means that Haven cannot make red blood cells. Therefore, Haven  relies on blood transfusions every 3 - 4 weeks to stay alive. Sadly, iron overload is an unfortunate downside to these life-saving blood transfusions. Apart from cancer, iron overload is one of the biggest causes of fatalities for those with DBA. Every transfusion Haven receives gives her 250 milligrams of iron. Generally, a person only needs 1 milligram of iron a day. The human body cannot remove excess iron so when there is an overload, iron deposits can form on the liver and heart. The only way to help with the iron overload, unfortunately,  is a treatment called chelation.  However, the effectiveness of chelation relies on the doctors' ability to accurately monitor the iron deposits and adjust treatment accordingly. As Haven's parents, we want her to enjoy a full, happy, and relatively normal life. Although we hope and pray that Haven will be able to overcome DBA, DBA may very well be a lifelong battle. Words cannot possibly describe how grateful we are for your generosity. As inadequate as a simple yet heart-felt ""Thank you!"" seems, this is all we can say.

CT and MRI scans revealed that she had a tumour in her cerebellum. On Tuesday, January 15th, the neurosurgeons at the Stollery Children’s Hospital removed 100% of the tumour.  But on Thursday February 7th, after the biopsy and pathology report came back, we found out she has been diagnosed with Medulloblastoma sub-group 3, a highly aggressive and malignant form of childhood brain cancer.  Because of her age and cancer type, her doctors are saying that her best possible chance for a cure is to undergo 6-9 weeks of an advanced form of radiation therapy at the University of Florida's Proton Therapy Institute, before continuing with chemotherapy at home in Canada. This therapy will target the cancer cells directly while causing the least amount of damage to her developing brain and young body. The family will likely be able to secure funding for the treatment itself, as well as for Aven and one companion to fly over. Her mother Jacqueline is planning to travel with her, leaving behind Aven's dad, Aaron, and their four other children: Gigi, Lily (Aven's twin sister), Jimmy, and Ammon, who is not yet 3. All expenses aside from the treatment and flights over will be up to them to provide up front and they are considering all options available to them, including applying to charities to potentially get some costs reimbursed. All this comes after a prolonged period of financial hardship for Aven's family. The social worker assisting Aven's family has recommended that they open an account to help cover incidentals for an entire year of treatment, and this will be an ongoing challenge for them. Anything you could contribute here would help Aven's family manage the cost of any medication and treatments not covered by the insurance or government subsidy, (such as physiotherapy). Funds raised will also be used for such things as transportation, accommodations, and food for Aven and Jaqueline while they are out of the country, and expenses for the family for when Aaron has to miss work in the next year of Aven's treatment. Our sweet Aven has overcome a lot so far and her recovery after brain surgery is considered miraculous. But she still has a long way to go. Throughout it all, she has remained one of the kindest, most generous and loving little girls I know. Please help ease her family's burden as Aven continues to fight for her life. Every little bit will make a difference and will be so greatly appreciated! If you would like to know of other ways you can help, please consider the following: -Organize a bottle drive in your community or participate in the Martin family’s fundraisers (Locally there will be a family dance, a bottle drive, bake sales, etc.) -Reach out to any friends or family that you have in that part of Florida, as they will need a support system while there -Air miles transfers so that Aaron can travel to provide occasional support for Aven and Jacqueline. -Cash donations directly to Aven's bank account (please email for more details at:  ) -Gas and grocery gift cards (mailed to PO Box 1632 Onoway, AB T0E 1V0) -Continued prayer and positive thoughts sent their way. -email   to find out about even more ways to help Please SHARE SHARE SHARE online and with your community networks and work internal bulletins.

He was involved in a horrific accident which resulted in 3rd and 4th degree burns covering his entire face and upper body.  Immediately after the accident, he was rushed to the nearest hospital that would be able to treat him. Nearest being 5 hours away. Our heart still aches thinking about the excruciating pain he endured in those hours. We are so thankful he is getting the care he needs and currently recovering at a burn unit hospital in Saigon, Vietnam where he will remain until further notice. He has an extremely long road ahead of him and will require countless surgeries, facial reconstruction procedures, therapy, rehabilitation, etc. and is expected to be off work for the unforeseeable future.  To help alleviate the amount of stress to be expected from medical expenses and supporting his family (as he is the sole breadwinner) while he begins his journey of recovery, we are reaching out for your support, both in prayer and any financial assistance you may be able to provide him in this time of need.

Three agonizing weeks ago our family's life has changed forever when Zina decided to have a planned surgery to correct a deviated septum to help her breathe through the nose. During the evaluation before the procedure, her doctor noticed something strange and took biopsy. Results of the biopsy came back with the initial diagnosis of a rare undifferentiated sinus carcinoma – stage 4. Adding to the shock of this diagnosis, she was advised that this type of cancer is not treated in Ukraine, and that the closest place to obtain treatment is in Israel.  Zina and her mom immediately flew to Israel where she underwent nine more days of numerous tests at the Ear, Nose and Throat Disease Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology Department at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva. We were hoping that her stage would not be advanced. Unfortunately, today Dr. Popovtzer, Head of the Neck and Tumor Unit, confirmed that Zina indeed has a rare advanced cancer – stage 4A of the sinonasal undifferentiated carnicoma. It is rapidly growing and has already spread to a lymph node; it is also threatening her right eye. The doctor says that Zina needs to start treatment immediately. According to the treatment plan, she needs to undergo two months of aggressive chemotherapy with Cisplatin and then radiation. If all goes well, she will not lose her right eye, although her eyesight will suffer. Zina is trying to stay strong relying on the support of her family and friends. Zina's friends in Ukraine and Russia raised money to help cover the diagnostic tests. Moving forward, the cost of Zina’s treatment is estimated at $65,000. The hospital requires her to pay half of this amount to start her treatment. Please consider sharing Zina's story and donating -- our family will greatly appreciate any amount. All of the raised money will go toward paying her treatment bills.  I will be posting updates on Zina's treatment. Thank you for taking the time to read my niece's story.",1550131200,65000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/zhnYTt7HMu-nIHXaJtcGaJxDmEo=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36916516_1550195556748559_r.jpeg,,4560,a woman standing on a boat in the water .,nan,

She’s been struggling with over eight years, and throughout the time she's had different treatments. Her cancer was initially breast cancer, but later on, it expanded to her lung, as well as her bones and a few brain tumors. Throughout time the medication made her weaker causing her to have mobility issues, leading her not to be able to walk. In the last five months, she’s been in and out of the hospital, which made the doctors conclude to terminate her cancer treatment - meaning they’d only treat the symptoms, but there's no treatment for cancer. From hearing this, she was given the option to stay stuck to a bed or go back home to Zacatecas where she grew up and has family. Unfortunately, cancer affected her lungs which resulted in her need for an oxygen tank. She hasn’t been able to work since she was diagnosed with cancer, so her main income was her daughter Yuvia, but due to circumstances, they don't have enough funds to cover the medication that her mom needs. The oxygen she needs to travel costs $2400, plus we're also trying to see if we can cover any other travel expenses that they'll have. It'd be greatly appreciated with any help that you guys can give them and help Evelia have her wish to go back home and spend her remaining time with her family.

296,https://www.gofundme.com/f/hannahsendosurgery,Endometriosis Surgery for Hannah,"Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women, and has no real cure. The best treatment is excision, with natural menopause a close 2nd. Endometriosis is the result of endometrial tissue somehow escaping the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, and attaching to organs, nerves, muscles, etc inside the abdomen. It can even spread into the lungs, joints, and so forth. For symptomatic women, it has been described as equally or more painful than childbirth. Endometriosis can also cause a host of other issues as it is affected by hormones and can set things off balance in the system. Ovarian cysts, fibroids, polyps, and adenomyosis are among the complications associated with the condition.  In January of 2016, I was laparoscopically diagnosed with endometriosis. At the time, I was told my only treatment option was a drug called Lupron. This drug is a series of injections that causes temporary simulated menopause and ""may provide some temporary relief."" It is unsafe to use Lupron (or Orlissa, the oral version) for more than 2 years due to increased risks of stroke, heart attack, various cancers, and bone loss. I opted to manage my pain which consisted of being bedridden with pain for a few days every month instead of trying Lupron for these reasons.     Last August, I visited the ER for unexplainable pain in the right side of my abdomen. It turned out not to be my appendix, but a ruptured ovarian cyst. In December, it happened again, and the pain didn't go away. I immediately scheduled an appointment with an OBGYN. It felt like ages to wait for this exploratory laparoscopic surgery. I was (am) in pain every single day, some days so badly that I thought surely something had exploded inside. .  Fast forward to February 7th, after multiple trips to the ER, CT scans, bloodwork, ultrasounds, and IV pain meds. It felt like ages to wait for this exploratory laparoscopic surgery. I had to fight the good fight to get the surgery. I called the doctor every day to check for cancellations. I went to the office once and demanded to speak with him. I called the insurance company and the surgery scheduler every day for a week to get the authorization pushed through.   I was sure there was something beyond ""just"" the endometriosis I had been managing for the last 3 yrs. I was right. Not only is the endometriosis now spread throughout my abdomen that ""no wonder"" I have been suffering, according to my doctor. Told ya? Additionally, I have uterine fibroids and polyps, likely adenomyosis, plus a rare condition called PATSS which means, in laymans term, my cervix is covered over in scar tissue so I cannot bleed. Thus, the pain is not cyclical, but constant.  His recommendation is to remove my uterus and both ovaries, in an effort to solve the uterine exclusive diagnoses, and prevent further growth of endometrial tissue. However, the endo tissue is attached and embedded on my bladder, kidney, muscles, sciatic nerve, and more. Even a full hysterectomy will not relieve the pain in these organs. The only cure for endometriosis is excision (cutting out of the endo tissue.)  What I would like to do is plan to have the hysterectomy WITH excision at the same, eliminating the endo and pain and potentially saving one or both ovaries so I don't have to go through menopause at 35! Most OBGYNs will not do excision, and even if they were willing, only a specialist should perform such an invasive procedure.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as an Endometriosis Specialty, according to the insurance world, and no OBGYN that specializes in excision inside my Medi-Cal network. I will have to pay out of pocket for the surgery and travel costs (a Dr at Stanford is the closest provider) which will likely cost more than my fundraising goal. I have no choice but to give this fundraiser a shot because I need my life back. My kids need their mom back.  I can assure those of you that don't know me well enough to already know this: I fully intend to pay every ounce of support forward, financial or otherwise. I will contribute any unlikely leftover funds to raising awareness for Endometriosis,  and/or toward the next sufferers crowdfunding goal.  Please feel free to message me with questions! I can assure you that I have done about 60 hours of medically-supported research and talked to hundreds of women with real experience to back it up.

We contacted the vet that did the surgery and he wanted to see him right away. We found out his eyelids are curling in causing scratches on his corneas. The vet thinks the cherry eyes were holding the eyelids in place and this is why it wasn’t an issue until the cherry eyes were fixed. We had to have surgery on his eyes to have sutures places in the eyelids holding them out. This is to hold him over until he can see an eye specialist and have corrective surgery. We have to get this done as soon as possible as it can cause him to go blind. The specialist is going to be expensive then with the surgery it is going to be outside of what we can afford.

I mean, I did help as much as I could, but I cannot do it alone, without you. So, if you can, please join me in helping this brave and dedicated volunteer from Russia, who helps homeless animals no matter what and does that all by herself. Margarita Morozova from the town of Noginsk, Moscow region (Russia) helps homeless cats and dogs to get off the street and find a loving home. Unfortunately, the government does not provide any support and that job is done exclusively by individual volunteers or private shelters and people, like us, who make donations to help. A week ago, Margarita, who lives near a large residential construction site and regularly comes there to feed homeless dogs, discovered that one of the dogs had just given birth to five puppies. She decided to save them, took them off the street and found a foster home, where the dog Mom and the puppies were taken without any advance payment. Now, Margarita is raising money for vaccinations, tests, checkups and foster care. So, far she was able to raise $120 out of $520 needed for the first month.  Margarita is desperate and has only one week to raise the remaining funds to pay for the foster care. I have been in touch with her and decided to help. We are raising money for two months of foster and medical care ($750), which should be sufficient to get them ready for adoption. Please consider making a donation to help those little cuties.

312,https://www.gofundme.com/f/gman-healing-fund,Join the Force: Care for Greg Owen,"Because our friend and fellow glassmaker,   was diagnosed with gliosarcoma, a rare brain tumor, earlier this week, we are generating financial support to help him receive treatment. Earlier this week, a debilitating headache sent Greg to the emergency room at Swedish Medical Center in Ballard, Seattle, where he was immediately transported to the CTScan and MRI unit at First Hill. The scans revealed a cancerous tumor. Greg underwent brain surgery on Monday to have the tumor removed, and he was released from the hospital on Wednesday afternoon. Greg is currently staying with friends in Seattle.  Unfortunately for so many friends and colleagues within our creative community, we know from (too many!) recent experiences that brain cancer is an expensive, and potentially aggressive, disease. Greg's surgeon reported that the resection was successful, and the team took extra time to confirm the greatest possible results. Even with 100% resection, brain tumor recurrence is probable, thus Greg's current course of treatment will include radiation and chemotherapy, with additional medication to prevent seizures and alleviate pain. Greg's treatment will also require that he receive regular MRI scans for the rest of his life to monitor potential regrowth of the tumor. An appointment is scheduled with his care team for early next week, when more information should identify the type and grade of the tumor, and provide additional information about treatment. *Follow up: the tumor has been identified as gliosarcoma, a rare form of glioblastoma, which is an aggressive cancerous tumor that originates within the brain.* Funds raised on Greg's behalf will go directly to the costs of his medical bills, and to support the secondary and ongoing expenses associated with brain cancer. Greg is a self-employed independent artist and entrepreneur. Contributions to Greg's healing fund will help pay for his medical bills and ease the financial strain while he is unable to work.  Greg is a talented and creative glass sculptor and significant contributor to the international glass community. He helped build the ""Hotshop Heroes"" program at the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, WA, a PTSD recovery program through which wounded veterans learn to blow glass. Through his involvement with the glass community, Greg has cultivated a substantial social media network of glass enthusiasts. He uses social platforms to educate the public about glass, and build awareness of artists using glass around the world. We know Greg is eager to get back in the studio to make glass and share the process with his enthusiastic social media following, but it is so important that he can rest and recover first.  We hope you can contribute to this fund for Greg (  ). If a financial contribution is beyond your means, please consider these additional ways to help: • During the 6 weeks of radiation therapy Greg would like to stay as close to Swedish hospital on Broadway (in Seattle) as possible. If you can help with housing or transportation, please let him know. • Share this story with your friends and connect with Greg's community on social media.  Instagram:   YouTube channel:    • All positive energy and healing thoughts are gratefully accepted.

Robin had stepped out, and came home in time to find Wall Fire Company #1 battling the flames that engulfed her home. She pleaded with them to let her inside to find Sam, her tabby cat.  Firefighters told her to wait until it was deemed safe, but assured her that her Sam had been seen.        Robin’s hardships didn’t start the night of the fire. Sadly, a couple of months ago, a sudden illness took the life of her other kitty, Itsy, and Robin is still mourning his passing. For years the three, Robin, Itsy and Sam, lived together in this home. Now, as she faced the flames, Robin feared the worst: the loss of her remaining companion, Sam.        When Robin was allowed inside, she, with the aid of few officers of Wall Township Police, searched desperately for Sam. The side of the house where the car had hit and caught fire was damaged. The electric and gas had been shut off. Robin could not live in the house and was told she had 10 days to remove her belongings. She couldn’t bear the possible loss of Sam and slept the first night in her car keeping vigil. By the next day, the animal rescue community had networked, shared, made calls and with the help of some angels were able to locate and retrieve Sam. The story was followed by many on fb, including the brave folks of the wall township fire and police departments, and the story has been covered by the local news. Robin, at age 71, is a faithful, independent, woman who has been through a series of challenges these last few months. Although Robin is a positive person, counts her blessings, and hugs Sam with relief and joy whenever she can, she is finding she must face the harsh reality of finding a new home, maintaining her employment status,  and meeting sudden and growing expenses, all under a severe time crunch. (Robin did not have rental insurance and is paying out of pocket.)       Robin tells me she is humbled and grateful for all the interest and help she has been given. And many who followed this story have asked how they can help her. This fundraiser has been created for her and Sam with the goal help them in  their current situation. Robin has always been a generous person, a champion for animal rescue and offers prayers and support whenever asked. Now is her time of need.

For those of you who don’t know, Kiki has been going through some serious health issues for the last few weeks. These events have set her back from working and more (which we all know she loves Ale House).  On December 30th she went to the hospital because she was experiencing a lot of pain in her leg.  The dr didn’t find anything wrong and sent her home with no real answers. The next day,  on New Year’s Eve, Kiki was rushed by ambulance to the hospital due to severe pain and bleeding.  They determined that she was having a reaction to her birth control, and again sent her home to wait for it to pass thru her system.  After a week she wasn’t getting better, was still in extreme pain, unable to walk, eat or sleep.  Every few days a new symptom would show up. On January 9 she was having serve chest pains and having a hard time breathing. When she went back to the ER they ran more tests and found she had three blood clots, one in each lung and one in her left leg. All of this was due to her birth control and needless to say, left unnoticed it would have ended very badly... She is going to have to be in the hospital for a few more days, but the good thing is she’s alive.  As you all know Kiki is a sweet, caring, loving individual, and will do anything for anyone without hesitation. She would never ask for help for herself.  She won’t be happy we did this, but we know that she needs to focus on getting better.  Obviously she has been unable to work for a couple weeks, and will still need more time to recover.  On top of normal bills and expenses, there will now also be medical bills.  She loves Ale house as if they were her own family, and truth be told-we are her family.  She is such a vital part of the Ale house, having done over 20 openings and helped coach and train countless people within the Ale House. We want to let her know how much we love and appreciate her, we want to show her that we have her back. While she’s focusing on getting healthy, we want to help alleviate the the financial burden she inevitably has due to a lack of income right now.  Individually we might not be able to do much, but together we can come together to show her the love and support she needs in a tangible way.   Any contribution, no matter how small will be greatly appreciated to help alleviate the financial stress and will be one less thing that Kiki has to worry about.

Family Needs Help,"My dad (Kenny Pontius) was a 70 year old Vietnam veteran when he got his cancer diagnosis in July 2018 (stage 3 lung). He and my mom moved in with us so we could help them through this difficult time. Over the next few months he successfully completed 33 radiation treatments and 6 chemo treatments. On October 30th he was admitted to Ball Memorial Hospital, Muncie, IN. due to not being able to carry his own weight on his legs anymore. He spent the next 65 days in the hospital battling pneumonia, whole body infection, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease which resulted in the amputation of both of his legs mid thigh. Through all of this, he kept his faith and remained strong. He was a devoted family man, and hated the time of year he was in the hospital. He was there through the kids trick or treating for Halloween, my wife's birthday, my son's 9th birthday, thanksgiving, his 71st birthday, Christmas, and new years. I used all of my vacation time to be with him, and took quite a bit of time off unpaid. My mother has been unemployed for several years to help with some of his other health problems, and when the cancer diagnosis came we made a family decision for my wife, who comes from a medical background, to stay home as well to assist with his ever growing needs. During his 65 day stay in the hospital, we had a few mishaps at home as well. One of our dogs somehow turned the water on in our upstairs bathroom while we were all with dad at the hospital, which resulted in our bathroom being flooded, the kitchen below it flooding as well, and the water finally settling in the basement. Our other dog and two cats have had various health problems draining the family savings account to care for them. The last of the major events being when a driver cut my mom off on state road 32 in Farmland to get into the American Legion parking lot. My mom, wife, and kids were on their way back to the hospital from our home in my minivan. When the driver cut her off, she swerved to avoid the collision and went into the concrete culvert, totaling our van. Everyone walked away without any major injury, thank God. The other driver didn't even stop. They just continued on into the Legion parking lot giving no thought to my family. We finally got to bring dad home on Wednesday January 2nd at 8 p.m. On Saturday the 5th, a severe stroke landed him back in the hospital where he was readmitted and spent the next few days. More severe strokes followed... Yesterday at 11:45 a.m. his fight ended. Ours did not. I promised my dad I would take care of the family. It was his only request these past several months. Unfortunately with everything that has happened, our savings has been depleted and his Social Security and pension went away with him effective immediately. I WILL figure out how to take care of my family and provide for them all that they need. However, I am asking for help to raise enough money to offset his lost income for the next couple of months until tax season, in order to help cover household bills and groceries, hoping that I can utilize anything we get from our tax check to help get us into a position for me to be able to maintain all of the bills for our household and my mom, who will continue to live with us indefinitely. For anyone who reads this and finds it in your heart to help a family in need get through a difficult time, I say this...

We're taking a leap of faith that our community will help us share this fundraiser and have it go viral to not only join us in prayer for Shauncey's healing, but to also bless her with a donation to cover medical and traveling costs.  Below is her story:  Shauncey had a 10 year career at Intel in the training department in Rio Rancho, NM.  She loved her job. She used to have a healthy lifestyle and was an athlete, who enjoyed runs down the ditch bank and long mountain bike rides on the weekends.  Suddenly that came to an end.   She became ill with 103 degree fever, developed a rash, and had no energy to get out of bed or fathom the thought of stepping outside; after these symptoms she never recovered and has progressively become more ill over the years. She's been sick for 20 years and has been to the  Mayo  clinic three times. She's been to every disease specialist in New Mexico, a few in Texas and Arizona.  She was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, and then eventually chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS).  When she got the diagnosis for the CIRS she thought she finally had the answer to her illness and could begin a treatment plan!  But, it wasn’t, So, that meant she had to go back to the drawing board.  Her doctor recently ran a Lyme Disease test and it came back positive and positive to several of the co-infections.  She started traditional treatment for Lyme Disease but have not received good results.   This is typical for someone who has had Lymes for 20 years and it has gone undiagnosed.  She found a doctor in Spokane Washington who has had great success with chronic Lymes patients.  The waiting list for this specialist is long, but she has been granted an appointment early this summer. Her symptoms are so severe that it is impacting her appetite and ability to keep food down, and there are other organ complications. The treatment cost and travel arrangements for her and her husband and son are costs we hope they don't have to be burdened with. The medical cost have mounted up over the years, and her husband has been carrying a heavy load.  He works every bit of overtime he can find but it’s not enough, and they need a financial blessing.  She is a believer in Jesus, and has faith He will ultimately heal her, miraculously or through the means of a medical professional.  She and her family have prayed for healing from the beginning and will not stop praying or believing, we ask you to join us in lifting Shauncey in prayer and kindly consider a financial donation.   Thank you for taking the time to read this and your consideration in helping her family through this journey with a financial donation.",1549526400,25000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/rb2cSVeJ-orCkvYPLHDyAEzZyek=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36916166_1549602869267141_r.jpeg,,1320,a woman wearing a tie and a hat .,nan,

Jemal was driving his car on January 1, 2012 New Year when he was hit by a drunk driver who crossed a red light at a high speed T- boned causing Jemal’s car to be smashed. Immediately following this high speed crash, Jemal was taken to Baylor Hospital Trauma Center.  He was attended by the ER physicians and nurses trying to save Jemal’s life.  With multiple fractures and severely damaged internal organs causing profuse internal bleeding, onne of the trauma surgeons in attendance gave unhopeful glimpse of Jemal’s chance of surviving at 2%.   Knowing this, the doctors performed multiple surgeries on Jemal. Following this intensive surgical procedures Jemal was transferred to ICU (Intensive Care Unit). He was not able to breath except with a support of a ventilator and was to be closely monitored should his breathing stops.  He was in the ICU for 5 months and his condition improved slowly.  He continued to have extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation. By the grace of Allah Jemal was not only breathing again but he was able to walk away from ICU and walking again.   However, Jemal’s life has never been the same after the 2012 car crash.   In addition, Jemal has incurred hundreds of thousand dollars for his surgeries and hospitalization.

It is our faith in God and our loved ones that help us navigate the rough spots.  A week ago I was diagnosed with Cervical Cancer. I will be having corrective surgery on February 25, 2019. The surgeons have estimated my recovery time to be anywhere from two weeks to a month.  Due to my Cervix surgery I will be forced to take unpaid time off from work. I started a great new job in July of 2018, but unfortunately the first year of vacation days is minimal at best. Due to the newness of my job, I find myself needing to come to all of you for assistance. I’m hopeful you’ll find it within your heart to help.  While on unpaid time off I will need to continue making all of life’s required payments, i.e. rent, electric, food, etc. If you find yourself able to make a donation to my GoFundMe page, I’ll be able to focus on my recovery, and not be worried about what’s next. This would be a huge comfort in my healing process.  For anyone who knows me, you know that my faith, positivity, and love of all mankind are the cornerstones of my being. Please know that once I beat this and recover, my next move will be to pay it forward on GoFundMe pages for people in similar situations. People helping people is  what it’s all about.

339,https://www.gofundme.com/f/restoring-former-record-store-glory-to-9th-and-9th,New local business seeking aid,"On Tuesday, Feb 4th, I submitted a Letter of Resignation at a great job I've had for the last 7 1/2 years. I did this because I wanted to pursue my longstanding aspiration of owning a record store. A dream I've had since I first saw HIGH FIDELITY in Jr High. What better location to manifest this destiny than the 9th and 9th Area of Salt Lake City. The former home of the record store that instilled and dictated the trajectory of my listening habits. It's my turn to impress adventurous sounds upon the ears of fervent listeners.  I wasn't anticipating cost(s) for build-out furnishings and equipment to eat up my funds as quickly as it did. My investment in the project is the $30,000.00 worth of records I'm sitting on. Here I stand with a signed lease and low on capital to fully realize this space. I was denied a loan from the city that would've been used to make up the difference of what I was investing in the project. If you know me, you know that asking for help is the last thing I ever want to do. I don't have other options, so here I am asking for your support. My personal assets fall short of the $25,000.00 that I require. Selling everything I own of value should get me $10,000.00. So I'm asking for your help to raise the additional $15,000.00. I'm asking because this is a venture I truly believe in. If you know me, you know that when I'm passionate about something I will do everything possible to see it through.  I'm asking for these funds to pay for necessary shelving and furnishings provided by my contractor and designer. Any additional funds will go towards upgrading the house audio system. I'm hoping to have the shop opened sometime in May and am doing everything possible to ensure it's open by June 1st at the latest. Your sharing this + donations, help ensure this is possible.

352,https://www.gofundme.com/f/analieses-journey-to-new-lungs,Analiese’s journey to new lungs,"Analiese is a 19 year-old college student and actively volunteers in her community. She was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was just 5 days old. After 19 years and the latest bout of the flu last January, she was told that she will need a lung transplant.  Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that starts when the cells don’t release salt properly. Due to this, Analiese’s body produces a thick mucus that clogs her pancreatic ducts, intestines, sinus cavity and lungs. She suffers from frequent upper respiratory infections and illness. Because of this, she describes her daily battle to breathe, similar to the same sensation as plugging your nose and taking every breath as if through a straw. Her case is more complicated because she also has Hyper IGD syndrome. The combination of the two diseases makes her a frequent ER visitor and resident at the U of I. She spent 104 days of 2018 in the hospital and is currently back due to severe inflammation and respiratory infections. Despite what Analiese is going through, the Chapman’s are lucky. Community members who love and support Analiese surround them. For years, they have worn Analiese’s face on their T-shirts, held walkathons to raise funds and awareness for Cystic Fibrosis, lined up to visit her in the hospital, and followed her journey through social media – all under the Team Analiese banner. Maybe you know Analiese. Maybe you knew her when she went four-wheeling or volunteered with the Riverdale Fire Department. Maybe you met her in college classes or when she worked at the community college bookstore. Maybe you know that she likes art, caring for her nieces, competing in water fights, sitting around a bonfire in her backyard, cooking dinners for her parents, or spending time with her friends – all the activities 19 year-olds enjoy. So now, Team Analiese has a new mission. Analiese needs new lungs so she can get back to all those things. And we need you to join us. While Analiese’s health insurance will help cover major medical expenses, it does not cover everything. The Chapmans live more than an hour from Iowa City where the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics are, that has been treating Analiese since she was a baby. We expect Analiese will get much sicker as she is waiting for her new lungs. Her mom has already taken a leave of absence from work because Analiese has gotten so sick and will have to take off another minimum of 3 months to take care of her during recovery. All while her dad travels back and forth from their home in LeClaire, Iowa to keep working. Your donations will help the family with expenses related to her lung transplant- travel, hotel, bills, food, etc. After surgery, if things go smoothly, Analiese will spend some time in the ICU and about two weeks in the hospital. When she’s released from the hospital, she’ll need to spend two to four weeks within 30 minutes of the hospital in case complications arise. When she is finally able to go home, she’ll need to travel back to the hospital each week or sometimes more for testing. Your donations will help with lodging; food, transportation, and time off Analiese’s parents need to take to be by her side.   Analiese needs new lungs, and we know that can only happen because a caring individual in life decided to donate their organs after death. Please register to donate. You won’t need you organs when you pass away, and people like Analiese will make good use of them. It gives them a second chance at life. Learn how to register in your state here:  . Your generous donations will keep this family afloat while they are facing one of the toughest medical trials of Analiese’s life. They need Team Analiese’s support more than ever. Consider joining our team, every little bit helps.

Michael is in very good spirits although he is very sick. Mike has a three year old Daughter named Ruby whom he loves very much. His doctors have just informed him he cannot continue with his job as a carpenter which he truly enjoys doing, his company is ran by our Grandfather who was one day passing the torch to Mike and his son Mark, now it looks like mikes goals have been taken away from him. Recently he thought he had Bronchitis which he went to the doctors multiple times. The ER kept sending him home with medicine for two weeks until he finally went and the doctors noticed he wasn't improving. It was then when he found out he was in congestive Heart failure. Michael was diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy which is a serious Heart condition in which runs in the family.  It was very bad and Mike was admitted to Albany Med .They then installed a defibrillator in case of a heart attack. He was very sick but they thought that he had improved enough to go home. Once home he noticed a pain and trouble breathing. He went to the ER and they found pulmonary Embolisms in his lung(bloodclots). He was admitted again into Albany Medical to help get rid of the blood clots only a couple of weeks after the first visit. A couple of weeks later Mike called his Doctor to tell them of a pain below the right side of his ribs. His doctor then called him back the next day and told him to leave work as soon as possible and go to the ER. He then went to the ER immediately and was admitted again to Albany med for two weeks this time until February 7th of this year. They found out his heart had gotten worse and was pumping fluid into his liver causing his liver and gall bladder to become congested and they swelled causing the severe pain. They were going to rush him to Monte Fiore in NYC right away to await a donor for a transplant. Instead they tried new medications and got him in good enough shape to go home to see if the meds will work off the IVs. Michael still needs a transplant and has to drive once or twice to New York City to make sure everything is ready when the time comes which may be tomorrow or a little later down the road but he will get it there's no doubt about it. Mike had many goals such as to go to school to become an electrical engineer something he has pursued but his beautiful daughter was born. Now with being on disability and constantly going to the doctors and now going to New York City Mike cannot afford to achieve his goals. This will help Michael achieve his goals and help to take care of his daughter along with help him get to his doctors appointments and to  New York City which is a three hour drive one to two times a month. Michael is the kind of person who doesn't accept handouts and has worked hard for everything he's every had so this is really hurting him. Please help my brother so he can maintain completing his goals and to take care of his daughter.All donations and prayers are truly appreciated with every fiber of my families beings.

374,https://www.gofundme.com/f/hughes-family-fundraiser,Hughes Family Fundraiser,"Hi Friends and Family!  By now most of you have heard the news about Baby Bennett.  Megan and Jason were on a cruise when Megan’s water broke early at 22 weeks.  After a scary stay at a hospital in St. John’s Antigua, they were able to be life flighted back to the US where they were admitted to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Unfortunately, due to several high risks associated with Megan’s water breaking early, they will not be able to return home to Ohio until after Bennett is born and released from the NICU.  There is a high possibility that they will not be able to come home until May, depending on how early he is born.   Many of you have been reaching out to me and asking how you can help the family during this time.  The biggest hurdle that Megan and Jason are facing is where they will stay after Bennett is born.  We are very fortunate that right now Megan is in a private room with a separate bed for Jason and I to take turns staying with her.  However, once Bennett arrives and Megan recovers from delivery, she will be discharged as a patient and they will no longer be able to stay at the hospital.  This means that Megan and Jason will need to organize their own lodging during Bennett’s NICU stay, which could range anywhere from several weeks to several months.   To help reduce some of the financial strain of paying for a hotel and transportation back and forth from the hospital during the NICU stay, I am organizing a fundraiser for anyone who wishes to help.  Jason and Megan are not ones to ask for assistance, but I know they were forced to pay several thousand dollars out of pocket to the cruise ship hospital, as well as several thousand dollars to the hospital in Antigua before receiving any medical care as these places did not accept their insurance.  This is in addition to the money they will have to pay for a place to stay while Bennett is in the NICU.   Megan and Jason still have a long road ahead, but I know they are so thankful for your prayers and well wishes.  God Bless!

After the extensive surgery of reconstructing his jaw with bone from his tibia and 3 years of treatments, he successfully beat this disease and was in full remission.  His zest for life allowed Justin to move forward from these challenges allowing him to enjoy his love of the great outdoors until at age 25 when the cancer returned, this time in his knee.  He was told that amputation was the only option.  For those who know Justin, this simply was not an option.  With his strong will, he set out on a path of tirelessly searching out alternative holistic methods of treating cancer.  He found the right treatment for him and after only 6 weeks, had seen a 90% remission of the cancer that nearly cost him his leg.  Once again, he beat the disease and lived a normal and extremely active life until he was 31 when the bone cancer returned, this time in his leg and back.  He fought hard and using his successful holistic approach went back into remission for another 6 years. This past August, Justin received the devastating news that the cancer had returned, this time having spread to his liver.  Though in typical Justin fashion he is continuing to battle this disease hard, its rapid and sudden onset caught he and his loving partner Leanne by surprise and unprepared.  Leanne has stood by Justin’s side every step of the way, personally covering expenses as necessary and taking all the time off work needed to ensure any support Justin needs is there.  They have exhausted all financial resources available to them and there is still a long road ahead. I am creating this GoFundMe page on behalf of Justin and Leanne with the hope of raising funds so they can continue this fight together.  100% of the proceeds will go directly to them to help. We know if there is anyone who can send cancer back into remission again, it’s Justin.  He just needs some more time. With your help, we can help support Justin and Leanne during this difficult time and lighten some of the burdens they have so they can focus purely on his health and path to recovery.

We rushed to the animal hospital where Max met us, hoping he would get a cast and they would be sent home with a hobbling dog. A couple of hours later, the vet came in with X-rays, which showed a break from the fall, and another fracture which was due to an aggressive bone cancer eating away at the main bone in his front leg. Needless to say, it was a complete shock to hear this 8 year old boy with the attitude of a puppy, who was just playing fetch in the house and running out the door to go on a walk, is extremely sick. The only option to keep this sweet boy alive was to amputate his front leg, and start him on chemo therapy for any cancer we can’t see on scans yet. After a day and a half of tests, he is finally getting his amputation today.

In poor health and unable to make up these losses Barbara could use the generous support of those who once knew her. Please consider making a donation to help our former teacher, employer, colleague and friend. To some of us, Barbara Luehning wasn’t just an art teacher... When I was 12 years old I told my grandparent’s I wanted a TV for my room. MomMom told me that as soon as I got a job and saved up for one I could have it. She didn’t believe for a moment that I would actually go out and get one... at least anytime soon. The very next day I had one compliments of my middle school art teacher, Barbara Luehning.  Against child labor laws, paid cash, likely off the books and well below minimum wage I bussed tables in 5 to 7 hour shifts at The Beachway Restaurant over the summer and on weekends over the off season as long as they were open. I was queer, gangly and awkward and she knew it. She gave me much more than the means to buy a fourteen inch tv. She gave me a safe space to grow and develop there and in her classroom free from taunting and ridicule. Without saying a word, crossing a line or doing anything that might embarrass a tween/teen finding his own path Barbara stood guard over me without my ever realizing it.  She was fierce to behold standing tall and upright, red hair cut close to her scalp, eyes like an owl. She was dignified and elegant in a way that stood out on Chincoteague. She stood out. She was unorthodox, sharp too and, honestly, sometimes cutting. You didn’t want to cross Barbara when she was in a bad mood... But it all fit, like the pieces of a puzzle... Barbara... Its more than a little sad to think of Barbara as incapacitated or in reduced circumstances. Its heartbreaking. Our upright and dignified art teacher with the sharp laugh... and tongue...  Whether she gave you the inspiration to express yourself, your first job or a B in art you’ll never forget Dr. Barbara Luehning for the rest of your life. Please help me in honoring her by helping her in this stage of hers. Thank you, Kevin Below is a link to a news article able how Barbara was taken advantage of.

He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer of his body’s plasma cells.  While this condition is treatable, there is currently no cure.  Tom didn’t let this news discourage him. He was determined to win.  For almost nine years he endured countless surgeries, chemotherapy treatments, and radiation.  He even underwent a bone marrow transplant, which kept him in the hospital of over a month.  During this time, there were many setbacks, but he never let it deter his spirit.  He continuously kept a positive attitude.  Despite all the odds being against him, his will was unbreakable.  Tom did not go gently into the night.  He fought with everything he had until the very end.  Even as it seemed his time was running short, he was determined to remain at home with his family, and his best friend, his yellow lab (Harley).  In the early hours of January 7th, Tom succumbed to his illness and passed on.  While it may seem like he lost his fight, those who were there with him, know that this is not the case.  Tom saw the arrivals of four more grandchildren, and the wedding of his son, Mark.  Our family will forever cherish the additional time that we were able to spend with him as a result of his courage.  The financial burden of all of this has been great.   In lieu of flowers...

Mindy was adopted by her forever family in October 2017 from Monterey County SPCA. Following many years of neglect from a previous owner, she had finally found a home filled with love. She made herself right at home, and wasn’t shy to show off her sit, speak, and spin skills! She was delighted to go out on the town and pick out her forever favorite toys. She is truly a light in the lives of all who know her! Her owners were thrilled to give her the life she truly deserved. On December 8, 2018 Mindy began to show signs of severe anemia, and was rushed to Pet Specialists Monterey for emergency care. It was discovered that her red blood cell count was well below normal, and she would require a life saving blood transfusion. She was diagnosed with Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia, an oftentimes chronic condition in which the immune system attacks its own red blood cells and breaks them down. After four days in hospital, Mindy was sent home on a comprehensive medication regime and slowly began to recover. She was soon back to her rambunctious, happy self. The prognosis seemed to be approaching the positive. On February 5, 2019 Mindy went in for a routine check up with her specialist and showed a dramatic decrease in her red blood cell count. She became severely anemic, was wobbly and unable to properly stand as her count was dropping rapidly. She required hospitalization, and two transfusions with very slight impact. She is currently hospitalized at Pet Specialists Monterey and requires very intensive care. Her family stays with her for hours on end, and would move in just to be near to her if they could. The cost upon this second hospitalization has grown exponentially, although her family is doing all that they can to ensure she receives the very best care, no matter the cost. With continued transfusions, Mindy has been placed on Prednisone as well as Cyclosporine, in order to attempt to suppress her overactive immune system. There has been talk of a splenectomy, though there are very few studies with regard to the procedures effect on patients with IMHA. Her family is continually by her side as they monitor her progress. The current cost of her treatment is currently just below $4,500, with costs rising potentially beyond this point. In order to fully treat this condition, much more intensive care is required. We all hope and pray that more successful research is conducted for patients with IMHA, and hope that you will support our little warrior Mindy in her own fight. We will keep you updated as everything proceeds, we are immensely thankful for the help we have received!

Home. Let’s make the rest of his good days count! Our dad, 62 (born on Guam), has been battling Parkinson’s for the past 22 years. To those that are unaware, Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disease that attacks the brain and mobility functions with no known cure… just yet that is! As complex of a disease it is, Parkinson’s is a very “designer” disease in which all symptoms may be different for each patient. For the past few months he has been in and out of the emergency rooms/hospital due to new symptoms that he now faces in which include advanced stages of Psychosis (hallucinating and delusions at times). The beautiful part of this new chapter is that during these times Dad has heard and spoken to Jesus, to whom he refers to as ""Jess"". Yes, they're buddies :)  After further evaluation by renowned specialists and leaders in the Medical/ Neurology field, they advised that the next best step for him would be to get admitted to a skilled nursing facility. After a 22 year battle thus far, being in and out of hospitals under micro evaluation with new symptoms along with adjustments to new medications, he now requires hired 24/7 professional care. He has been in the Skilled Nursing Facility, and has had to face the fact that this is  the only route we currently can go. Hiring the in home care he needs ranges between $7,500-$11,500 a month.  Although it truly is a blessing that he has been accepted into the facility, deep down, he is unhappy. Some days are good, and unfortunately most days could be better. The good days we are fortunate to have the real man Benny is: Funny, outgoing, always the crowd entertainer, etc. On the bad days, he fights this battle, and he fights this battle with all his might. It has been a very emotional ride seeing Parkinson’s take over, but the battle is not over yet! With the help of medication adjustments and considering another major procedure (aside from the two brain surgeries he already underwent known as Deep Brain Stimulation) to help tame the battle,   is all of our wishes. With the best care, that is. At this young age, and the fact that not only he, but we are fortunate to have these very unpredictable good days as to where he beats the Parkinson's battle, there is no better way than to spend them, how he wants. Having a limitation of 4 hours a day we can take him out of the facility, goes without satisfaction for those good days he still has.   Those of you that know “Benny” know that he deserves the world. His ever so big, warm heart has touched every single person close (and even distant) in so many ways. He keeps the world around him smiling, even knowing all the suffering that he is undergoing.  Not only has the rock of our family, our mom, survived two battles of breast cancer, but she has been the primary caregiver to dad. The physical attention the care requires, is now beyond her control as the battle she has twice defeated with breast cancer, she needs to uphold. The behind the scenes care for a Patient with Parkinson’s (PWP) is a very strenuous job. A job that has also emotionally and physically impacted not just dad, but mom, his two daughters and everyone else close to him. To watch this battle take our hero of a dad has been one long emotional roller coaster. We all want what’s best for him (emotionally and physically) in addition to living and enjoying his life comfortably, and most important, happily.  Our family consists of his Wife, Emma along with two daughters, Kathryn and Desiree. Benny, Sam Diego State graduate,  formerly an Engineer of 18 years  followed by becoming Vice President  & Chief Finance Officer of a Marketing firm. Due to the critical symptoms of Parkinson's he then had to put a halt on his career. He did everything in his power to continuously make sure ""his girls"" were happy. His passions consists playing basketball, piano, guitar, singing, and most importantly, making everyone (including strangers) smile. His humor, big heart and loved ones gets him through day by day. To conclude, our dad was able to let us “live the dream”. It is now with the help of Parkinson’s Awareness, and spreading the word for this cause, we can help him live his the best way possible. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the research of finding a cure of Parkinson’s. Thank you all for your support and please spread awareness! Please stay tuned for an addition to The Reyes Story along with more about Parkinson's Disease and the care/treatment needed. As the family is looking at every option possible, the immediate answer would be 24/7 hired care that can range from  . Other options still under research. The finances raised will help supplement what is already being contributed by his wife and daughters. Let’s get him back to where his home, heart and happiness is!

403,https://www.gofundme.com/f/do-it-for-kelly,Do it for Kelly,"Let Kelly get by with a little help from her friends... Hi, my name is Lee. I’ve been Kelly’s friend for 3 years now and take it from me, I’ve never seen a more selfless person and is always there when someone is in need. She cares for her seriously ill step father every day. She has been raising two children by herself, whom have been a handful, but is always there to lend them a hand to pick up the pieces when they are in need.  She has a modest position at a government agency, helping to find housing for people who aren’t as fortunate as most of us. Taking some punches along the way, Kelly has also been doing her best to manage anxiety and depression with medication and therapy sessions.  Well before we met, when Kelly was 11, she was involved in a serious car accident. In which, the car she was traveling in, rolled a number of times. Since meeting her in 2016, Kelly has always reported suffering pain and discomfort in her neck and upper back. Also enduring migraines. Which aren’t getting better. Her pain has now at the stage where she has trouble getting any sleep at all every night. As she is unable to position herself without pain.  ‘After some trouble with health services recently not authorising a more detailed scan (MRI) and her condition not improving. Kelly convinced them to do the scan and it revealed that she had a number of crushed discs in her upper spine, putting pressure on the roots of her spinal nerves. It also showed spurs, or bone fragments, which also need removing. Most devastating, is that the scan also detected a 4mm cyst on her brain.  Kelly has informed me that she is in talks with a surgeon and is now on the emergency surgery list (2-180 days) regarding her back, because of the severe pain down her spine. She just told me that the cyst is being monitored and will be treated after recovery from the back operation.  Kelly has been told that the surgery will have her in hospital for only a few days, but recovery will take up to four weeks. Kelly has told me that she has no way to pay her rent ($440pw) during those weeks of recovery and although she is unbelievably excited about ending her severe back pain, she is also very anxious about the consequences of being off work for that long. Given that both her kids are still living at home.  ‘To top things off, Kelly is also having some minor issues with the reliability of her car (starter motor and AC gas).  I’m doing this without her knowledge, because I’m sure that Kelly is most deserving of any help that the wider community can provide, but she wouldn’t dream of asking for help herself. So I’m asking all of you kind and caring people out there, just like Kelly, to spare whatever you can to lend her a helping hand to help get her through this challenging time. I am hopeful we can reach our goal. As there are so many people who are touched by Kelly’s kindness everyday!  I have listed a minimum goal of $2000 to cover the rent and some food to get by during her recovery time.",1549612800,2000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/wWMDOJwlLSJqsieZ0kSZ-m217fk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36915462_1549600652777760_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36915462_1549606520263451_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36915462_154960645689603_r.jpeg",200,a woman with a dog on a leash .,nan,a woman in a dress shirt and tie standing in front of a mirror . a woman in a white shirt and black tie

408,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-leandres-family-beat-cancer-together,Help Léandre's family beat cancer together,"(Version française ci-après) My nephew-in-love Léandre was diagnosed with a brain tumour on December 27, 2018. Four days later, on New Year's Eve, he underwent 10 hours of surgery to remove it. Although the surgery was a success and nearly all of the mass was removed, the tumour was malignant, so the next steps for Léandre’s treatment are radiation therapy and chemotherapy. ￼ The past weeks have been devastating. We are all reeling from the shock of his quick diagnosis: his mom Anne, his dad Denis, his little brother Audrick, his Oma Rosemarie and Opa Andreas, grand-maman Germaine, uncles Georg and Benoit, aunt Catherine (my sister) and cousin David (my son). Though we are not related by blood, I've known Léandre his whole life, and love him as a nephew. Léandre is ten years old. He is an extremely gifted violinist, who has been playing since he was 3 1/2 and competing since he was 4. He has won two silver medals at the Canadian Music Competition and has performed twice at Carnegie Hall!  Here is a   to hear him play at the CMC competition in 2017. And here is a   to his very first performance, at 4 years old. ￼ Léandre also swims, dives, rides horses and loves to read. He particularly enjoys books on ancient mythology; he raced right through all of Rick Riordan’ books, and read the Iliad and the Odyssey. He is bursting with life - kind, enthusiastic and passionate about everything he does. ￼ The Schwab-Gaucher household is filled with warmth. Birthday parties are marked by Anne's incredible homemade cakes, in the shape of planets, or sea creatures, and by elaborate treasure hunts and activities for the kids, animated by Anne and Denis and decorated by Oma's beautiful artwork.  ￼ Léandre and his brother Audrick, 7, are very close. Audrick looks up to his big brother, and plays the violin as well. When they are at Oma and Opa's house, they practice violin at the same time. Léandre plays for Catherine, and Opa accompanies Audrick on the piano. At home, Toxo the cat listens - of their four cats, he has the best musical ear. This past December, David and I went to Léandre's house to spend Christmas together with the family, as we do every year. Anne baked up a storm - I think she had 20 varieties of Christmas cookies this year. Léandre and Audrick had practiced some Christmas carols to play for the family, as duets on the violin. David had just started learning the flute, and had brought it with him. When Léandre learned this, he didn't skip a beat: he transposed his own harmony in his head, so David could play along in the key of C. It was one of those small but great moments that showed Léandre's generosity and irrepressibly positive energy. That was three days before his diagnosis.  ￼ It's hard to believe that was only five weeks ago. Though Léandre had been having some mild headaches and nausea for a few months, he was otherwise in perfect health. Today, he is struggling to talk, and his walking is unsteady as he recovers from the effects of the surgery. Every day is better, but there is a long road ahead. ￼ Léandre's tumour was a medulloblastoma. Despite its near-total removal, six weeks of radiation therapy will be needed to target the remaining cancerous cells and keep the tumour from growing back. Since the treatment he needs (proton therapy) is not available in Canada, the Montreal Children's Hospital has helped arrange for the family to go to the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where they have the specialized equipment and expertise required. After that, Léandre will go through four to six months of chemotherapy administered at the Children’s Hospital in Montreal. He may also need other therapies, due to the strong side effects of the cancer treatments. In order to be at Léandre's side during his battle, and to take care of little brother Audrick, his dad Denis has stopped working, and will not be able to return to work for the better part of this year. There is a government relief program for caregivers, but this will only cover about half of his salary, which they depend on. Without more help, their family will be in serious financial difficulty. ￼ That's why this GoFundMe campaign was created. All the money raised will go straight to Léandre's family, to cover their loss of income and inevitable extra expenses, so they can focus their energy on what matters: Léandre’s treatment and rehabilitation. They will be deeply grateful for any contributions.  ￼ With love, luck and support, Léandre will be back on his violin playing concertos well before next Christmas!  Love, Aunt-in-love Jenny    Mon neveu Léandre a été diagnostiqué d’une tumeur cérébrale le 27 décembre 2018. Quelques jours plus tard, la veille du jour de l'an, il a subi 10 heures de chirurgie pour qu’on la lui enlève. Bien que la chirurgie fût un succès et que presque toute la tumeur ait été enlevée, elle s'est avérée cancéreuse. Les prochaines étapes pour Léandre sont donc la radiothérapie et la chimiothérapie. ￼ Les dernières semaines ont été dévastatrices. Nous sommes tous sous le choc de son diagnostic : Anne, la mère de Léandre, son père Denis, son petit frère Audrick, sa Oma Rosemarie, son Opa Andreas, sa grand-maman Germaine, ses oncles Georg et Benoit, sa tante Catherine (ma sœur) et son cousin David (mon fils). Bien que Léandre et moi ne sommes pas liés par le sang, nous sommes liés par l'amour : Léandre est comme un neveu pour moi. Léandre a dix ans. Il est un violoniste extrêmement doué : il joue depuis l'âge de 3 ans et demi, et fait des compétitions de musique depuis qu'il a 4 ans. Il a gagné deux médailles d'argent au Concours de musique du Canada. Il a même joué deux fois à Carnegie Hall à New York! Voici un   où vous pouvez écouter une de ses compétitions en 2017. Et voici un   vers sa première performance, à 4 ans.  Il fait de la natation, du plongeon et de l'équitation, et il adore lire. Il aime particulièrement les livres sur la mythologie antique, et il a lu l'œuvre complète de Rick Riordan, ainsi que l'Iliade et l'Odyssée. Il est aimable, enthousiaste et passionné dans tout ce qu'il entreprend. ￼ La résidence Schwab-Gaucher est bien chaleureuse. À chaque fête d'enfant, Anne fait des gâteaux personnalisés incroyables, en forme des planètes ou de créatures marines. Il y a des chasses au trésor élaborées et d'autres activités divertissantes pour les enfants, animées par Anne et Denis et décorées par les œuvres d'art magnifiques d'Oma. ￼ Léandre et son petit frère Audrick, 7 ans, sont très proches. Audrick admire beaucoup son frère ainé, et joue également le violon. Quand ils sont chez Oma et Opa, ils pratiquent le violon en même temps. Léandre joue pour Catherine, et Opa accompagne Audrick au piano. Chez eux, Toxo le chat écoute en ronronnant – de leurs quatre chats, c’est lui qui a l'oreille la plus musicale. En décembre, David et moi sommes allés chez Léandre pour fêter Noël avec la famille, comme on le fait à chaque année. Comme d'habitude, Anne s’est surpassée dans la cuisine; je crois qu'elle a préparé 20 variétés de biscuits de Noël cette année. Léandre et Audrick avaient préparé des chansons de Noël au violon. David venait de commencer à apprendre la flûte traversière, et l'avait emmenée avec lui. Quand Léandre l'a su, il n'a pas hésité : il a transposé l'harmonie qu'il avait appris, dans sa tête, pour que David puisse jouer avec eux. C'était un petit moment, mais qui démontrait la générosité de Léandre et son énergie positive. C'était trois jours avant qu'on apprenne son diagnostic. ￼ Il est difficile de croire que cela fait seulement cinq semaines. Bien que Léandre avait parfois des maux de tête légers ou un peu de nausée ces derniers mois, il était autrement en parfaite santé. Aujourd'hui, il a encore de la difficulté à parler, et sa démarche est incertaine, dû aux effets de la chirurgie. Il s’améliore à chaque jour, mais il y a encore un long chemin à parcourir. ￼ La tumeur de Léandre était un médulloblastome. Bien qu'on l'ait presque complètement enlevée, Léandre devra subir six semaines de radiothérapie pour détruire les cellules cancéreuses restantes et pour empêcher la tumeur de revenir. Comme le traitement requis (la protonthérapie) n'est pas disponible au Canada, l'Hôpital de Montréal pour enfants a arrangé pour que Léandre puisse le suivre à l'Hôpital général du Massachusetts, à Boston, où ils ont les appareils et l'expertise requis. Léandre subira ensuite quatre à six mois de chimiothérapie, administrée par l'Hôpital de Montréal pour enfants. Il aura aussi probablement besoin d'autres thérapies, dû aux effets secondaires puissants des traitements contre le cancer.  Afin de rester aux côtés de Léandre pendant sa lutte, et afin de prendre soin de son petit frère Audrick, son père Denis a dû arrêter de travailler, et devra arrêter le travail pour la majeure partie de l’année. Bien qu'il y ait un crédit d'impôt du gouvernement pour les aidants familiaux, celui-ci ne couvrira que la moitié de son salaire, qui est la principale source de revenu de sa famille. Sans aide supplémentaire, ils seront en grande difficulté financière. ￼ Voilà pourquoi cette campagne GoFundMe a été créée. Tous les fonds reçus iront directement à la famille de Léandre, afin de couvrir leur perte de revenu et leurs dépenses inévitables. Ils pourront ainsi se concentrer sur ce qui importe le plus : les traitements et la réadaptation de Léandre. Ils seront très reconnaissants pour toute contribution. ￼ Avec de l'amour, de la chance et le support de ses proches, Léandre sera de retour sur scène avec son violon, bien avant Noël prochain!

Usually I'm the one who quietly does the little things for everyone else.  But at this point, I feel humiliated, dejected, like I have no self worth, and no matter how hard I keep trying, I keep getting beaten down.  I liken myself to Laura in the Glass Menagerie or George Bailey standing on the bridge right now.  Since my back injury at my last job things have been downhill and being in the emergency room back in June with a 10 day hospital stay on an IV antibiotic pump with no insurance just made things even harder.

I have managed to get a few interviews here and there, sometimes even three times with the same company.  I hear the same thing. ""You are so personable, such a pleasure to talk to, so intelligent, but over qualified. We just can't justify paying you what we're offering when you're worth more.""  I get this all the time. The big clincher is when I get asked: ""What was the reason for leaving your last job?"" and I truthfully answer about my back injury.   There is nothing at all even negative in my background or job history.  I can't even get hired as a sorter/hanger or cashier with Goodwill let alone a store associate/cashier with Aldi.  I've been applying for anything from my area of expertise in Facility Operations and management to a sales clerk and still, no one will give me a chance.  I'm convinced it's because of my back injury.  I know I'm doing everything right in interviews and in the job search process, and with proper professional follow ups.  But it is so taxing and wearing that I question everything I do now and my self worth and abilities.  And that's not like me. I ask every day now, ""Dear God, what am I doing wrong?""  A few times I was 100% convinced I landed a job and then, zero response.  I'll do email follow ups or phone call follow ups and get no response.  I just want to work, I need to work. But at almost 53 years old and with a back injury, I can't go do a heavy manual labor job anymore.  I just don't know what to do.  For a single 53 year old single man, there is no Health & Human Services assistance; I've tried.  I've depleted my savings and the little retirement I did have is gone.  I probably spend over 12 hours a day or more on the computer searching every job site, applying to whatever I can.  I'm at my wits end.  I feel so beaten and broken at this point and don't know were to turn.  It's such a helpless feeling of despair and so hard to keep my spirits up.  The constant worrying about where I'm going to get money to pay for rent, food, heat, pay for anything has me at my breaking point.  So someone suggested I try this.  I'm embarrassed and humiliated.  But I'm asking for help.  Thanks.",1549526400,1700,11,0,https://images.gofundme.com/KfepTugE9lUReguqPIDtaJd3WRk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36915272_1549688517218465_r.jpeg,,1240,a man in a suit and tie sitting in a chair .,nan,

There was nothing more important in life to her than family. My mother had the kindest heart and would do anything to help the people she loved and cared about. Whether you grew up with my mother, or grew up with Ashley & I at some point in life I know she touched your heart. We are all going to miss her very much. Her smile, her stories, her love, her companionship. My mother loved being with family & cooking for all of us. As most of you know, these past few years have been very hard on our very small family. After losing both of her sisters, she lost her daughter, my beautiful sister Ashley. Through all of that Gee kept fighting. My mother leaves behind two grandchildren, with a third on the way. Her sister Saundra in Ohio, several nephews, and myself. Its very hard doing this on my own. Any help during this hard time would be greatly appreciated. My mother and I had to do this last year, and coming from a family of only a couple it makes it very hard. I would like to be able to spend this time grieving the loss of my mother and supporting the children affected by her loss. Donations will go towards paying for financial obligations in such situations.  Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and showing the support and love you all have for my mother Cynthia Jane ""Gee"" Hawthorne❤",1549612800,1500,5,0,https://images.gofundme.com/aL0OWEt1acg9hB-9_CbGJmwKhQA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36915242_1549667003538815_r.jpeg,,548,a group of people sitting around a table .,nan,

He had a rent-to-own lease on the property, but the renter moved out without notice. It turns out he had not been making payments for several months. The mortgage company has only given Josh until February 13th to make up back payments before starting the foreclosure process. In order to prevent the foreclosure, he needs at least $7,500.   He also found out that the roof had been leaking, which has caused quite a bit of damage. To make the necessary repairs will be another $7,000 over and above what insurance will cover.   It will take a couple of months to make the necessary repairs and put the house back on the market. Josh will need at least $1,860 to cover the mortgage, insurance, and utilities in the meantime.   Having to come up with all of this on such short notice would be overwhelming for anyone. Josh works hard, with full-time and part-time jobs, but with kids to support he does not have this much money at his disposal.   Josh is a good person and has supported many a friend and stranger, often going out of his way to help others in need, and he doesn't ask for much in return. Now is our chance to return a little of that to him and show him that we also care! If you've seen him in acts of kindness to you or others, this is a way to thank him.   Josh has put his trust in God to help him work out this situation. And after investigating many different avenues has been left with needing the support of those who care about him.

My sons mother recently started dating a two time felon for heroin and crack distribution and spent 11 years in prison as a result. He was also on trial for murder but as a result of witnesses being afraid to testify, he was acquitted.  The Judge ordered her not to have him around my son, but she continued to violate the order 6 more time, with my son being hurt twice. She has handcuffed me financially as she refuses to give my 50/50 custody, and asked for more child support because she already has him an extra day, when I found out she was violating the order.  Now I can no longer afford the attorney I was planning on getting. The previous attorney I used has made things worse, and I’ve already paid them more than 9000.00 of money I really can’t afford. Now that I have to pay her close to 900.00 a month, it’s virtually impossible to get the help i need, which was her purpose. She has been telling my son to lie to his therapist on top of this all as she is what’s known as a covert narcissist. She lives with her parents and pays no bills there going on 5 years!

421,https://www.gofundme.com/f/ashton-blasts-hepatoblastoma-round-2,Ashton Blasts Hepatoblastoma Round 2,"Our sweet Ashton was diagnosed in June 2017 with Transitional Hepatoblastoma a rare liver cancer. He is 11 yrs. old and battling cancer for the second time. Hepatablastoma is 1% of all kids cancer but the blend Ashton has is actually about .20% not even a whole half a percent of kids cancer. He is absolutely one of a kind so there is no surprise, he would have something that would puzzle everyone. Ashton is an awesome kid! He loves his Fortnite and his friends.  He loves science and wants to be a doctor and what an awesome doctor he would be with all the experience he has gained in the last couple of years. He will bust out in song and dance in front of anyone anywhere. His favorite person to pick on is his dad. Ashton spent the second half of 2017 getting chemo, a life saving transplant, and then  more chemo. He did an adult chemo pill the beginning of 2018, then had liver rejection and finally the last part of 2018 he was able to be a kid and enjoy life a little bit. We knew there was a positive area of cancer on his inferior vena cava after transplant, but we thought the chemo we did after transplant had taken care of it. Unfortunately last month we found out its there and a few other spots. He had Surgery on Feb. 27th,2019 for these spots and we found more cancer than anyone anticipated. Our oncologists are going above and beyond looking for help on Ashton's puzzle. IV Chemo is not an option, so our docs have really reached out looking for new options. The plan is to start a pretty new adult liver cancer med as soon as things are straight with insurance. This med cost $18k a month, and we are still waiting to hear what insurance is covering.  The docs can't offer a good prognosis because this is all new territory, but we have faith Ashton will keep overcoming because God is walking with us. Financially, things are rough! We are about to hit two years since this all started. We live in North Mississippi and had just moved from Belle Chasse, La. the month before Ashton was diagnosed.  Ashton is mainly treated at Texas Children's where he had his liver transplant so we have to travel there often.  Our lives have always needed both me and my husband to work and that just has not been possible. With 4 surgeries, 2 liver biopsies, doctors appts. and labs at some points twice a week, 3 hospitals stays, and 6 trips to Houston just since April 2018 all while recovering from fighting, I have no idea what to expect while we are actively fighting. From August till Jan., I was able to help out a little substituting at his school, but I won't be able to sub again till Ashton can go back and that all depends on the side effects he does or does not have to the adult liver med.   Finances are definitely a balancing act of trying to keep Ashton as happy as possible, having money for all the medical expenses and travel, and just paying the bills that keep a roof over our heads and lights on. Truly, the credit cards and everything else we maxed out the last two years, I throw them in the trash as soon as I see them. I just really can't do anything about them at the moment. Right now Tristan's car is broke and our outside AC unit is broke so sometimes its seems more like an Avalanche than a balance. Everything always seems to work out thanks to everyone who has already helped, but there is so much going on right now that the stress is really working on me and Daniel both.  Please Share at the least and get the word out! Anything you can do $5, $10 it all helps! Thank you all so much for the prayers, shares, and any help you can give.There are just no words for what it really means to us.",1549526400,10000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/NgKpOdeyQZH16yKouAeTZj9EYvI=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyQcB1i-HZs/0.jpg,,1730,a woman in a red shirt and a red tie,nan,

In the last few months he began experiencing different symptoms and pain that doctors initially couldn't find answers for. After several misdiagnosis's, and a resilient effort by his son and daughter to get real answers, they began to uncover the truth. He is currently in Calgary's Foothills Medical Center receiving care, but has been told by doctors that there's ""nothing they can do"" because his body isn't strong enough to handle their traditional treatments (chemo and radiation). So his family has come together exploring every other option, and after exhausted research, they've started implementing high quality alternative medicine. After administering just one dose, Reg had his best day in weeks and was up walking around, talking and smiling after being essentially comatose and unable to communicate on the opioids. He was able to completely discontinue morphine and oxy-codone for his pain.. within a few days! He continues to use only these natural medicines for his pain management. It's clear that this treatment is working and everybody is on board and determined to give him every possible chance at fighting and beating his diagnosis with the use of alternative medicine. As everyone in the family struggles with his unexpected and rapid health decline, there are a lot of mounting costs that are adding tremendous weight to an already exhausting and overwhelming experience for all.  To help Reg continue his battle, we need to have a continuous supply of these products. We have connected with a high level supplier who has been sending us the best of the best - and it is a source we trust.  These products are expensive, and while the family is working together to fund the treatment, it will soon be too much to continue.  Beyond these products, Reg has been self employed running his own business for years, but with him being unable to handle his company, the bills are mounting and falling on his family to cover which is an added stress making everything harder. One thing about Reg is that he is, and always has been, a giving man. The type to ""give you the shirt off his back"", making sure others are taking care of and comfortable even before considering himself. On behalf of Reg, his entire family and all who love him, we are graciously requesting any and all support to continue this treatment which has shown tremendous results after doctors and the medical establishment have deemed his life over. We do not accept the fate they've given Reg and we plan to do everything humanly possible to prove there's another way! We thank you in advance for your generous donations and appreciate each and every one of you who takes the time to read this and take action. Help Reg fight for his life and beat the odds like many others have through alternative medicine that the mainstream medical practice refuses to accept.

429,https://www.gofundme.com/f/life-saving-seizure-alert-monitor-for-riann,Life saving Seizure alert monitor for Riann,"As many of my friends and family are already aware Riann has a form of epilepsy. Her diagnoses is Status Epilepticus. She has Tonic Clonic Seizures that when they start she has multiple seizures. In November of 18 she was taken to the hospital for seizures that would not stop. She had 19 seizures in 12 hours the last two lasted for forty five minutes. She aspirated and had to be intubated at which point they finally induced a Coma to get them to stop. That was the forth induced Coma in Ten years. This type of Seizure can be fatal with a mortality rate of 20% for the type with convulsions. She can, but at this point hasn't had the type without convulsions. That type is much more dangerous for her to have with a much higher mortality rate. Riann has had seizure for the last 12 years and during this time she has had many injuries do to falls. Riann has fallen and bruised her face, knocked out a tooth broke her ankle, fractured a vertebrae in her back and had to have a spinal fusion and black eyes. Her last serious injury was a full frontal face plant on a concrete sidewalk. I am sure I left some of them out,but there is one common denominator in all of her injuries. That is out of all the many injuries that has happened to her I have never been able to prevent them or catch her before she falls even though i am right beside her. It just happens so fast.  Riann and I need some help financially. we do have insurance that covers most of her care, but some things are not covered. There is an alert system that we need for Riann. This is brand new technology that is just now coming on the market. Riann is on a waiting list for this devise. The devise is an EMG Electromyography monitor. there are other monitors on the market, but they all work by the movement of the seizure. the EMG monitor will sense a seizure before the convulsion starts. this will give us a 9-10 second alert before the seizure starts. If Riann is walking this will give her enough time to sit or get in a safe position. Enough time for me to catch her from falling and an alert to wake me before her seizure starts. The latter is the scary part for me. She has seizures in her sleep and I don't wake up. Most fatalities happen from seizures while sleeping. We need this monitor for Riann's safety.  As I stated earlier we are on a waiting list I don't know when we will be notified when we can order, but what I do know is when the company calls for us to order I have seven days to purchase it or they move to the next on the list. We need help with funding, the equipment and supplies will cost $ 800.00 I never thought I would be writing for a Go Fund me account, but here I am. So my friends and family lets raise some money for the love of my life Riann.  The good news is Riann has been accepted too the Neurology department At Mayo Clinic. She is under the care of world renowned Neurologists. Her treatment will take time. they have a good idea as to where her seizures start in her brain. the doctors say if this is the case it is one of the best locations in the brain to treat. In order for them to be 100% positive of the location they need to capture a seizure while she is having an EEG. So far she hasn't had a seizure while hooked up to the machine. In April she is scheduled to have an ambulatory unit that she can ware home. Hopefully they capture an event so we can start treatment for her.  Thank you, and God bless all who help us get this life saving equipment for Riann.",1549526400,800,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/-75YwlIl-Q3bZgydwsSnVYOMV5w=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36914956_154959902091012_r.jpeg,,800,a man in a suit and tie standing in a field .,nan,

Bankers are resilient people, but everyone needs help at some point in life, and it is up to the rest of us to offer that hand of hope. The federal shutdown has caused a significant portion of our workforce to lose their income while not knowing when the next paycheck might come. Federal employees may receive back pay in the future but those who are contracted employees may never regain the loss. Some workers have been furloughed but others must work without pay.   In the meantime, bills are coming in for mortgages, rent, car payments, etc. Some are looking for temporary jobs to try to make ends meet, but this is the time of year when Dare County experiences the highest level of unemployment in the year. Many not affected by the shutdown are also looking for work due to being laid off in the winter. Local businesses are hurting because they rely on the federal payroll going through the local economy to help keep their cash registers ringing in the winter.  This is a disaster just like those caused by Hurricanes Irene, Florence and Michael, but it is man-made instead of weather-related. OBX Neighbors  want to help by raising funds to be sent directly to Interfaith Community Outreach for its director, Jennifer Albanese, to use to help individuals with immediate needs. ICO has long been the leader in helping to respond to disasters and this one is no different. Please let your neighbors who are suffering know that this agency is there to help them.

439,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-bert-and-finn-fight-poverty,Help Bert and Finn fight poverty,"*FOR ANY DONATION OVER 10$ WE WILL HAND DRAW YOU A PICTURE OF YOUR CHOICE! ❤️* Hi all! Please take time to read this as it explains everything :) My name is Bert. I’m 23 years old and I’m a recovering alcoholic. I struggle with severe depression and and I’m currently doing my best to receive the treatment I need, but am unable to. I’m currently in the process of applying for disability but it’s a very long process. Which is why I’m making this. I come from a Jehovah’s Witness background, which I left at the age of eighteen. This was by far the hardest decision I had ever made, as I had to completely restart my life over. The so called supportive and loving community that I had grown up with and my own parents turned their back on me and have cut out all contact with me due to my refusal to rejoin the faith.  I was still so young and the life I had before leaving the JW was gone. Thankfully now I'm very lucky to have my two sisters and some friends who have also left and have been huge supporters. This whole experience has left me with severe mental trauma. Growing up mentally ill in a JW family home is very draining and distressing, I felt often forced to suppress my emotions and this drained me because I often felt as if there was something wrong with me and that I wasn't normal. My parents didn't believe in therapy.  I’ve been receiving therapy for my various mental health issues but it has now become almost impossible due to my financial situation, which brings us here. Finn is my fiancé and she is one of the strongest people I’ve ever met. I’m so lucky to have her in my life. She suffers from severe mental health issues too such as BPD (borderline personality disorder), and an anxiety disorder. This has left her unable to work for the time being and she has been on sick leave for the past few months.  This has been extremely tough for her as she loved her job and the people she worked with, but her physical and mental health is and just was too poor. This means I am now the sole provider for my family. I have been let go from my job due to my mental illness and the fact that I can’t leave the house due to how severe my depression is. This has left my wife to be and I on the brink of homelessness.  We rent a room in a house for 750$ a month and are finding it almost impossible for us to keep up with the rent. Not only that, but it’s a temporary lease that ends in April, and with no savings and the high rent prices here in town it’s hard to have any hope. We also have a cat who is our therapy animal and is literally a best friend to us, but this also makes it harder to find housing. Giving him up would never be an option.  I have desperately been trying to find work but my mental health issues have made it impossible to do so. I have had multiple interviews but I don’t get the jobs due to how anxious I am, and probably from my noticeable facial tics from Tourettes Syndrome. I have have struggled from Tourettes since I was small. The therapy programs that Finn and I so desperately need, cost money to attend each session and gas money to get there. I’d bus, but again I have no money for fare, tickets, or a pass. Not only that, but we are unable to eat or afford the basic necessities like toiletries or Finn or I's medications. Groceries are so expensive and food banks can only offer so much because there’s so many people in the same boat as us, which has left us with empty stomachs from time to time. This has been incredibly difficult for us to share our struggle and write let alone ask for help. Anything from sending positive vibes to a dollar would help, we just desperately need to pay our rent this month and hopefully some extra money so I can finally focus on getting help for myself and my family.  Thank you all and have a wonderful day ❤️",1547107200,1000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/8WuVDXwNPLvIUhJTvd6o5LldedY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36086614_1547363852204705_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36086614_1547369160457520_r.jpeg,825,a young boy is holding a baseball bat .,nan,a woman holding a cat in her arms .

Instead of happiness of all the new that there is to look forward to, they started their year at Thomas Jefferson Hospital with more fear and uncertainty than most of us could ever imagine. At the age of 29, on the day before New Year’s Eve, Molly suffered a stroke.  She was immediately flown to Thomas Jefferson where she underwent two separate and very complicated neurosurgeries.  Fortunately, after a few very scary days, Molly has begun to show improvements.  She still remains unable to use the left side of her body, and has an extremely long road of extensive rehabilitation ahead.  Molly is the type of person that would be willing to help anyone at any time.  She is fiercely loyal, kind, funny and has the most infectious laugh. She deserves so much more than what she has been handed from this world.  So today, we are asking for your help.  We are asking for our friends, our truly wonderful friends, who need our help and support now more than ever.  Donations of any value are greatly appreciated.

453,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-lea-family-get-back-on-their-feet,Get the Lea Family Back on their Feet Again!,"( ) Hi, we are the Lea Family in Florida.  We are fairly well-known in the amateur radio world through our YouTube channel,  .  For those of you who don't know us, we are a homeschooling family of six and Dad (James) is the sole breadwinner, working as a freelance Director of Photography/Cinematographer.  James works for clients all over the world on various television shows, projects, and as a professional storm chaser and war correspondent.  His job entails carrying a heavy camera on his shoulder as well as carrying heavy equipment to and from shooting locations.    Mom (Michelle) has dedicated her life to training up the children according to their bents and to guiding them to be productive members of society.  She always looks for ways to be organized and conservative and she is quick to lend a hand to those who are in need.  Our two oldest children, Zechariah (16) and Faith Hannah (14) are dual-enrolled at Daytona State College and are doing very well in their studies.  (They are both in the top 5% of their class.)  They attend classes in Daytona Beach two days a week and we have to drive just under 150 miles a week commuting them to and from class.  Hope (12) and Grace (11) are homeschooled and very active on amateur radio and community service.  As a family, we have inspired hundreds of people to earn or upgrade their amateur radio licenses and participate in community service activities on a regular basis.  Our lives have been spent in the service of others. ( ) In October 2018, James was working covering the landfall and aftermath of Hurricane Michael in the Panhandle of Florida.  While shooting stock footage of the aftermath, he heard over amateur radio of an urgent need for communicators to respond to the affected area to help coordinate the relief efforts.  James immediately made the decision to put down his camera (meaning that he stopped earning an income to volunteer to help save lives) and spent over a week in the the town of Wewahitchka, Florida volunteering to provide life-saving communications via amateur radio.  Before arriving in Wewahitchka, he helped establish communications between the Emergency Operations Centers in Calhoun and Liberty Counties and the State EOC in Tallahassee.  James also helped provide communications to help get a paramedic who was septic evacuated via helicopter to a hospital where he was able to receive life-saving surgery.  This volunteer effort cost a significant amount of income because James was not out shooting footage that he could sell.  Once James was finished serving in the Panhandle, he returned home to be with his family in Central Florida.   ( )   In late July, while at home and through the negligence of others, James traumatically injured his right shoulder and recently underwent major rotator cuff surgery to repair the damage.  The process from injury to surgery took several months because of healthcare protocols.  Recovery may take as long as a year and he is unable to work as a Director of Photography/Cinematographer until he is fully recovered.  During this recovery process, James is unable to pick up a TV or cinema camera, much less put one on his shoulder!  Prior to the surgery, James had a large, well-paying contract for a training video that would have provided a few months income to help offset his inability to work.  Less than two days prior to the project's beginning (a mere week prior to the surgery), the client pulled out, saying that they did not know that James was not operating as a Corporation.  James spent two months being vetted for the job, including having to pass multiple security checks and drug screenings, all of which he passed.  We later found out that the client's client decided that they wanted another company, owned by a relative of theirs, to produce the project.   Our savings has been exhausted and the State of Florida does not have a short-term disability program for self-employed entrepreneurs.  In a short period of time, we have gone from self-sufficient to facing eviction and are unable to keep up with the bills.   We have cut our expenses to the bone.  (Did you know that you can get the same cell phone service that you would get from Verizon from a company called Total Wireless for about 1/4 the cost?  We found that out and we switched providers, as well as turned off one of the phone lines and kept only what was the bare necessity.)  We are making sure that we have multiple tasks to perform before driving somewhere and that we drive the most cost-efficient route.  We also cut expenses by moving to a much slower Internet service (we can't get rid of it because James is using it for what work he can do.)  The heat is tuned down low and we are judicious in our use of electricity and water.  For example, Michelle waits until it is cold to use the oven so we can open the oven door to help heat the house once the baking is done.   ￼( ) Michelle is using her talents to restore furniture to place it for sale to help bring in some income, and the kids are looking at ideas such as building amateur radio go kits and making paracord products to help supplement the family income.  James is cultivating a client who wants to produce a documentary in the next year and working to convince them to begin preproduction now, instead of six to nine months from now.  He would be able to do the preproduction work with his injury.  However, this client is starting to look like they may have decided to use another producer.  Unfortunately, our current efforts to support ourselves are falling short.     We are in immediate danger of being evicted from our home because we are unable to pay our rent and we have fallen behind on our bills.  In the short term, we need help getting caught up with our rent and other bills, such as electricity, water and insurance, as well as building a financial cushion.  In the medium term, we may need some ongoing help as we figure out how to provide for ourselves in new and creative ways.     Firstly, donating helps a lot and we sincerely appreciate it!  (It's very easy to do by simply clicking on the donate now button at the top of this page, on the righthand side.)  Other ways to help are by sharing our fundraising campaign with your friends and contacts on Facebook and other forms of social media, via email, text, and word of mouth.  Please take five minutes out of your day to share our story to as many people as possible. A quick email or a post on Facebook will make all the difference in creating a successful fundraising campaign for us! Most importantly, we need your prayers!

He had a presence about him, and his smile could light up a room. Although he could no longer speak, he communicated with us daily and fully understood our conversations and jokes.  He loved to joke around there's no doubt about that.  Although we are heartbroken that our baby brother, our Dad & Mom's baby boy,  has left this world, we are strengthened to know that he fought the good fight and is now rejoicing in Heaven. No more sickness, no more pain, no more restrictions, no more tears. Gabriel is now dancing and rejoicing with Jesus and knowing this freedom he has makes our hearts happy and filled with the peace that only God can give.  We have prepared as much as we could in such a situation but with medical costs and daily care for his condition and complications, my parents are still in need of assistance with funeral costs and other arrangements that need to be made.

459,https://www.gofundme.com/f/bebz8e-pastor-teo039s-road-to-recovery,Pastor Teo's Road to Recovery,"My dad, Pastor Kenneth Teo, was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer on his left upper lobe on April 2018. This was an incidental finding that surfaced when he had a CT scan done for a non-cancerous mass that had been growing on the right side of his neck. While working to find a provider and getting his medical insurance in order, months passed without any treatment plan. He finally got established with an oncologist at Baylor Scott and White in Dallas, Texas. The oncologist was caught up on my dad's story and ordered a PET scan to see if the cancer had metastasized to any other part of his body. Upon getting an abnormal result from the scan, a bone biopsy was done on November 2018 showing  that his lung cancer had metastasized to the T3 bone of his spine.  Initially, the oncologist wanted my dad to go through numerous rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, in which he would have to travel from his home of Mineola to Dallas every day (1.5 hour car ride each way). He tested the lung biopsy for more specific findings and found that the cancer cells had a specific mutation that could be treated by targeted therapy. He recommended my dad be started on the medication Osimertinib, a new drug that could be used to treat his certain lung cancer by preventing cancer cells from dividing and growing and can cause them to shrink and die.  This therapy comes in the form of a once daily pill. With the newness and effectiveness of the drug comes a high price. A one year supply of this drug would total $15,000 and his insurance can only cover 1/3rd of it, leaving $10,000 for treatment alone. He would also have doctor's visits and scans every 2 months to see if this drug is working.  The doctor also recommended he be put on another drug called Zoledronic acid to support bone strength due to the metastasis. This drug can affect his dental health and jaw bone so the doctor wants to proceed with dental treatment during his cancer therapy that would include complete extractions of all his remaining teeth (cost = $2,000) plus purchase of complete upper and lower dentures (cost = $1,500).  You couldn't find someone more deserving of help than someone who has given so selflessly in every way possible. My dad has been serving in Christian ministry for the past 33 years. Mercy ministry has always been his passion, with special interest in helping people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction in Singapore. In America, he established a food pantry that has fed thousands of people across Wood County, East Texas, houses the homeless that come through the surrounding community, and served 400 Thanksgiving and Christmas meals each year to those in need for 10 years all while pastoring in a local non-denominational church in Mineola. In 2009, he won the award for Humanitarian of the Year from the Mineola Chamber of Commerce. He's known around the whole community as someone who would take the shirt off his back to help someone in need. If you know him at all, you know that statement to be pure truth.  As expense on expense piles up, the financial burden of this diagnosis has been increasingly overwhelming to my family.  His battle with cancer has only just begun, but we really can't proceed without the help of our family and friends. Anything you give will go straight to his medical bills, and if you find yourself not able to supply any financial gift, we would sincerely appreciate lots of prayer. We believe that God has control over this situation and will be with us every step of the way.",1547107200,10000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/k7B4JXGsr4Tw8kh2Qb6vnpDTZe8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36086262_1547136658799607_r.jpeg,,3227,a man in a suit and tie is smiling .,nan,

We were going to take her to ACCT to get fixed but we discovered she was injured and could not use her back legs.   VSEC confirmed kitty has internal injuries, possibly from being hit by a car or being kicked/abused. An X-Ray is the next step to determine the extent of injuries.  The cost of an X-Ray at VSEC is over $400, so I took the kitty home to find lower cost options. I currently have an appointment at City Cat Vets on 1/11 for further analysis.

Due to a genetic defect with her teeth that led to multiple broken teeth and other problems, Laura had to get emergency dental surgery and literally had all of her teeth removed. On top of how insanely traumatic that has been, she was poorly treated by multiple dentists, denied insurance coverage, and left with no idea how to pay for a proper set of dentures. You can imagine how terrifying it is facing the prospect of learning how to function with no teeth.  Laura has been an amazing and steadfast friend of mine for years. She's a mom to four kids, works two jobs, volunteers with the Girl Scouts, loves running long distance races, and is a veteran to boot. She's also one of the most incredible authors I've ever read.  Laura is at home right now, recovering from the surgery, so I'm handling this campaign on her behalf. All the money raised will go toward purchasing a good, quality set of dentures for Laura, as well as helping to cover the bills that are piling up from missed work.  It's absurd and unconscionable that this is even necessary, but it is, and there's nothing we can do but come together and try to help each other out.

468,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-olsen-brothers-spend-time-with-their-dad,Help the Olsen brothers spend time with their dad.,"Before I begin, I'd like to say thank you for all of your prayers, love, and (in advance) any donation you would make.  My name is Joshua Olsen. I'm the big guy with the beard in the above photo, and the guy with the moustache is my brother, Noah. This fundraiser is actually about the man in the middle of the picture, and the events of the last few days. That’s my dad, Dan. Dad is my hero. I'd love to explain the many reasons he's my hero, but that requires more words than I'm able to offer at present. The Events: Dad's health has been up and down in recent months, but he didn't receive any serious diagnosis. On February 5th, while my dad was at work, he began experiencing confusion and slurred speech. A nearby coworker and a supervisor immediately took action, calling an ambulance. My dad arrived at the nearest hospital with all the symptoms of a stroke.  After a full CT scan of his brain had been completed the doctors assured us that it wasn’t a stroke. With dad's symptoms getting worse, even having a severe seizure, doctors placed dad on life support in an induced coma. The Fear: We thought we might never be able to speak to dad again. While he was awake he couldn’t understand us or coherently communicate. After, his chemically induced coma allowed doctors to run the necessary tests, but we didn't know what his state was going to be when he woke up. If he woke up. However, the following day brought us much hope. Dad woke up!  He was still on life support but his vitals were increasingly stronger. He even regained enough strength to breath on his own, so he was moved to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). It was in the ICU that we were given the results of all the tests they had been running. We were told that dad has cancer. The cancer had begun in his lungs and spread to his brain and adrenal gland. The direction of medical care for dad depended on which option he chose: He could have 2 weeks and up to a year to live. The Reason for Our Need:  Noah and I decided we want to be available full time for dad. We've both taken leaves-of-absence from work to increase the quality of dad's remaining days. We believe this is the best thing we can do to serve and honour him. The decision to be with my dad is important, but we recognize the challenges it brings. I feel the tension to secure provision for my family. I have a wife and three daughters (Selah 3, Sparrow 1, and Lydia 6 mo). Noah and I also have mortgages. Our mortgages and responsibilities are important, but they're less vital than this opportunity to share in our dad's final days of life. We're reaching out in the hope that you might be able to help with some costs associated with our decision: - Our monthly expenses  - Food for dad  - Care for his pets  - Hospital parking  These listed expenses are for Noah and I, per month, totalling about $5,800. Our goal equals slightly less then 3 months of expenses.  More important than anything else (I cannot stress this enough) is your prayer to the Lord God for us, our dad, these circumstances, and more. Thank you.",1549699200,15000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/5K12xKMOMycURJRrvLGJ_83oUpE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36914904_1549598534112051_r.jpeg,,6150,a man in a white shirt and a black tie,nan,

Their hearts are big and they know there is a plan for them to bring a child into their loving home. I simply cannot put into words the love, kindness, selflessness and generosity these amazing women have.

We have been informed that this could be a result of a severe case of strep throat he suffered as a young child. Instead of healing normally like most cases of strep throat both of Luis’ kidneys were scarred. This leads us to where we are today, Luis is in the end stages of kidney failure; we predict that Luis will be on Peritoneal Dialysis by Springtime this year. Luis’ dialysis treatments will be conducted at home; meaning he will be hooked to a dialysis machine for 11 hours every day. At this stage, his only options are dialysis and kidney transplant. With a transplant being the only long term treatment for this condition. The ultimate goal for Luis and his family is to pursue a kidney transplant, but in the meantime dialysis is the only option. Luis grew up in Woodland California, after journeying to the United States with his family in search of opportunity. A son of two farm laborers and a farm laborer himself, Luis enrolled in college ultimately graduating from Sacramento State with a degree in Civil Engineering. While in college Luis cultivated strong connections with his Gamma Zeta Alpha fraternity brothers. Luis currently works for Caltrans as a Civil Engineer. During his free time, he enjoys playing golf, watching his beloved Raiders and of course spending time with his family. Luis’ immediate and extended family care for him very much. His gregarious nature welcomes everyone into the fold. You are guaranteed a laugh when you are around him. This has been a difficult time for him with his chronic illness culminating to this point, but he has not lost hope and neither have his loved ones.  While some of the costs will be covered through insurance there are a million and one extra expenses associated with the day to day process of dealing with a chronic illness such as kidney disease. These costs include expenses associated with traveling out of town for multiple nights to and from specialist appointments, prescriptions, as well as expenses associated with missing work due to his illness. Your donations will go directly to Luis to help defray the endless expenses associated with his chronic illness. This is a difficult journey for Luis, Your support would mean the absolute world to not only him but also to his family. Luis is married to his wife Carol and they have two beautiful young daughters Aveleen 10 and Addisyn 9. So this page is a call for help. Please join us in our support of Luis!

473,https://www.gofundme.com/f/champlainbirth,Help Rachael Become an IBCLC,"My work as a Doula started six years ago, but my love for supporting birthing and postpartum families started nearly a decade before that with the births of my two youngest sisters. Since I was a teenager I have wanted to help new families, and when I discovered Doula work I never looked back. My practice has evolved over time. I started out as a birth Doula, but now I make my living almost entirely by doing postpartum work. I am one of the only Doulas in my community who offers overnight support to families, helping them get precious sleep, knowing that their infants are in experienced hands. Sleep deprivation can be a major component in postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, and I have seen many times how extra support can make a real impact.  My Doula training prepared me to support families, but left me lacking in the knowledge I needed to offer comprehensive breastfeeding support. For many of the families I work with I am the support person who truly gets to know them and their babies. On a number of occasions I have been asked to attend meetings with an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) to help speak to their journey and their struggles. If I were trained as an IBCLC myself I would be able to offer hands on, comprehensive breastfeeding support and work with families and their care provider to ensure that both the baby and nursing parent are thriving. Becoming an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) is an involved process which includes 90 hours of specialized training, 45 hours of which will be obtained in a week long intensive hands on training, college level study in fourteen health science courses, five additional required Lactation specific courses, and 500 hours of directly supervised apprenticeship with a practicing IBCLC. You can see the full requirements here:    This is a huge step forward in my career, and it will take a significant investment in terms of time and money to obtain it. Knowing that I will be able to better provide for my own family, while supporting so many families in my community, makes it all worth it. Which is where this fundraiser comes in. I know with enough hard work and dedication I can achieve this goal, but with the support of my community I can truly focus entirely on accomplishing this next step. If you can donate you will have my deepest thanks and appreciation. If you can’t, consider sharing this so more families know about the options they have for support in their own community. At the end of the day, if just one family sees this and knows they do not have to go through this time alone, it will have been worth it.",1549612800,2000,9,0,https://images.gofundme.com/XvfeC5VO04wChd_j1xSfHzll81c=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36914800_1549664323124656_r.jpg,,460,a man in a suit and tie is smiling .,nan,
474,https://www.gofundme.com/f/6un5ov4,Medicals Bills and Heart Transplant,"In 2014, our father's life changed forever when his heart suddenly stopped. We are grateful he is still alive, however his life has changed drastically, and so have the lives of his wife and 3 children. Before the incident, he worked for the Fedex shipping packages and for Tesla selling cars. He was the most hard-working, loving and involved father. He would always be at work trying to make enough money to take care of his kids, but the sad turn of events is that it was all of this work that ultimately made him sick. Him wanting to provide for his loved ones, made him sick, it isn’t fair. In May 2014 he had a cardiac arrest and was put on life support at the University of Maryland. Then he was given an lVAD (left ventricular assist device) to help his heart pump at Inova Fairfax hospital and before he was allowed to come home in August. In 2015 there was an infection at the site of the IVAD insertion and he was moved onto the heart transplant list in hopes of attaining a functional heart, which he did get in October 2015. However, in December 2016, our dad’s body had rejected his new heart. The doctors put him on life support once again before transferring him to VCU in Richmond where he suffered from another cardiac arrest in March 2017. With no other solution, the doctors transplanted an artificial heart into my father’s chest in April 2017. Since then, the doctors have been working continuously on finding a heart that is the perfect match for our father, one with an immune system that isn’t so aggressive in order to prevent another rejection of the organ. The only thing my father can do is wait because currently, he has too many antibodies ready to attack a newly inserted organ. Our father is still unable to work and with a family of six one can only imagine the hardships our family goes through to make ends meet. But debts are piling up and our bills are so high, every month gets harder and harder and we do not always know how much longer we can go on living in this constant state of stress. Our mom tries her best but can only work part time because she has to take care of all of us when we get back from school; also because our father cannot stay by himself, someone needs to stay beside him at all times just in case machine stops. Please, if you can spare a few dollars, we would be more grateful than words could explain. If not, we completely understand, everyone has their own hardships and we wish you the best.

476,https://www.gofundme.com/f/michelle039s-scoliosis-surgery,Michelle's Scoliosis Surgery,"Hi, my name is Michelle.  I'm 16 years old, I'm a junior in high school with hefty aspirations.  I was diagnosed with severe (operable) lumbar scoliosis when I was about 12 years old.  Scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine, and in many cases can have  a long term impact on one's health and can even be life threatening if left untreated.  I have a S-shaped curve and my last-measured degree of curvature was 48 degrees, above the recommended surgery level of 45 degrees or more.  At the time of my diagnosis I was prescribed with a Boston Brace which I wore for two years in an effort to prevent my scoliosis from getting worse over time.  Wearing my brace was very challenging, leaving my torso chafed and sore much of the time, and I was always embarrassed to embrace my close friends and even family.  Unfortunately, it did not correct the curvature of my spine as seen in the images, and I still live with back and hip pain on a daily basis. I have grown out of my brace and I can no longer wear it.  This causes me severe lower back pain quite often.  My doctors have told me that my options are to get the surgery as soon as possible or to wait until I'm older, but the risk with waiting  to get it when you're older is that the curvature could possibly get a lot worse and the recovery is harder since your bones are not as flexible later in life.   Since I'm a junior in high school and my senior year should be focused on college and my future, I figured that this upcoming summer of 2019 is when I want to get my surgery so that I am fully recovered for my senior year and leading into college with my best foot forward. Not only is the surgery going to be hard already, but it is going to be especially draining for me because I have a genetic blood clotting disorder called Factor-V Leiden, which makes it more risky to be cut open, because I'm 8 times more likely to form blood clots than the average person.  In addition, medical research shows that orthopedic surgery creates an even higher risk of clotting than other types of surgery, which is really scary for me and my family because I'm at a much higher risk of stroke and/or heart failure due to my conditions. My high school has four structured ""Academy"" programs.  One of which is the HBS (Health & Bio-Sciences) Academy and it is designed for students  pursuing a future career in the medical field.  HBS is the curriculum I have been in during each year of my studies in high school.  While I haven't yet determined the specific medical field I'm going to enter, I'm leaning in the direction of either orthopedics or cardiology because both fields are important and impact me personally, and my immediate family as well. My goal is to finish high school in these honors and advanced placement (AP) classes that I've been taking, and to seamlessly and 'comfortably' go to college to further pursue my future career in the medical field without delay - whether transitioning from high school to college, or from college to beginning my career, in which I will have patients depending on me to present, attentive and focused on their healthcare needs.  My fear is that if I wait to get the surgery until after my senior year, I will jeopardize any possibility of taking advantage of scholarships and other endeavors that I pursue to further my education and my career hopes and dreams in the medical field, so for me; the time is now!   Another one of my goals is to be able to help others who truly need an advocate and fluent communicator when managing their health; the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.  I have learned American Sign Language (ASL) over the last 2 years and I'm committed to improving my ability to communicate with the deaf, because I feel that they are at a disadvantage when dealing with their doctors, and I believe I can help them get the care and dialogue that they deserve too.  If you would be so kind as to help me raise these funds (any amount you can spare) by this summer, June 2019, it would help so much more than I know how to describe.  My parents don't have good or private health insurance and they don't have the money it would require for me get the surgery, the treatments, and the physical therapy that I'll have to undergo to properly heal - let alone any money for my college & career aspirations.  I don't have grandparents to help out, so my mom and dad have been raising me and my brother on their own, in every way, without the ""typical"" family assistance from grandparents, or aunts & uncles - like which many of my peers take for granted.  This is due to genetic disorders on my mother's side of the family and unforeseen deaths on my dad's side of the family.  That's why I have posted this page.  I need all the help I can get, and likewise, I want to help those as mentioned above who are unable to effectively communicate with their doctors, and get the real compassionate care that they need too.  Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and consider helping me.  I personally thank you very much and I promise to put your assistance to the best possible use for my health, my education, career, and to those less fortunate than me.

I have seen her struggles but more importantly, I seen her work hard to catch up with her bills.  She received an eviction notice due to owning 3 months . She is really trying to pay this, but every time she pays her monthly rent plus some of the past due, another month comes by and she falls behind again, 70% of her paycheck goes to rent. She is 61 years old working like a 22 year old so she doesn't become homeless like many Americans now a day. Prisilla is well known in our community, she had help many people, and is always willing to keep helping others.  I decided to help her by opening a go fund me as the last re-sours to help her, since I myself am  a full time college student and can't come up with this amount on my own to assist her on covering her debt.

I am majoring in Business and Organizational Psychology.

I am also a part of the intercultural inclusion department of our student government where we help to put on events surrounding diversity.

484,https://www.gofundme.com/f/6un3yio,Support for Stacy,"My sister Stacy has been battling a rare form of Neuroendocrine Cancer that originated in her right upper lung and has since spread. This type of tumor kicks off an excess of hormones that has caused debilitating symptoms that have caused her to miss a lot of work. After months and months of testing at the U of M, Mayo Clinic and most recently the University of Iowa where she had the tumor removed a few months ago, unfortunately the symptoms have returned, which led us to the realization that the cancer is not gone and it had unfortunately spread.  This is only the beginning of her journey and I have started a Caring Bridge site to keep everyone updated on her progress, testing and treatments.  Several of you have asked us how you can help, and as much as I want to say that prayers, love and support is enough, it just isn't. Stacy recently lost her job which included her full-time benefits because she hasn't been able to work for the better part of 2 years, leaving her with the only option to continue this fight, which is Cobra through her previous employer.  As you can imagine, her medical bills have been piling up and the long trips to the University of Iowa for further testing and treatments have been taking a toll.  There is no cure for this diagnosis unfortunately, only symptom management and suppression of the tumor with specialized medications, which is also very expensive.  If you are looking to help, she needs a lot of prayers, positive thoughts, texts, calls, cards, visits, and if you would like to help with her medical bills, I have started this Go Fund Me Page as another option.  Honestly, it took some time to convince Stacy that it is OK to accept help from others in a time of need, so I apologize that it took a bit to get this going. As much as she has given of herself to help others over the years, I am not surprised people want to pay it forward, and we cannot thank you enough for that and for everything you have so graciously helped with already.

Before she can have that surgery they have to get her arthritis under control. Kelby has seen more of the inside of a hospital than she should have since she was just five years old. So far, 2019 has been a very rough year for this little girl and her family. Kelby has been in the hospital more than she has been home for the month of January and after the 1st week in the hospital Kelby was placed in inpatient rehab at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock. Doctors are trying to find ways to make everyday living easy for her. The family was informed her stay could be anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks. Her medical records have been sent to the NIH where they are trying to get Kelby in a Stills study.There they can get bone Marrow samples, joint fluid samples, and everything in between to try and find a reason why the multiple medicines Kelby takes do not work very long for her.In addition to having a home nurse that will come and visit Kelby, this little trooper has to manage a routine of medicines that you and I only see on tv. She is so brave! Her home health nurse that comes once a month also gives her a injection of Illaris. (Which, we are sad to say is not working for her) She also takes Humira every week.Jackie and Brad are trying everything in their power to help Kelby just be a happy and energetic little girl again and get to go back to school and be able to do everything a 12 year old should be able to do. However in order for the doctors to get Kelby the help she needs they have to be able to allow Kelby to stay for as long as she possibly can and receive as much treat meant possible, therefore her mom has to be able to stay with her. Kelby’s mom, Jackie, has so far been off with her the whole time through her stay at Arkansas Children’s but unfortunately funds have become scarce and this family truly needs our help!

Nobody would have ever thought that the guy jumping over walls covered in mud and fixing the very radiation machines that are now saving his life, would be doing all these things while an aggressive malignant brain tumor was taking over.   On Wednesday, November 7th Johnny finally agreed to go to the hospital for the headaches, dizziness and nausea that he had been working  through for 72 hours.  It was then that a stunned ER doctor informed Johnny, at  36 years old, that  the  CT scan showed a 4cm by 4cm brain tumor.   Tumor was causing his brain to be shifted to one side and beginning to crush critical portions causing his symptoms.  Within 48 hours the tumor, thankfully, was successfully surgically removed.  In true Johnny spirit he was up walking around and watching the football game in 24 hours after surgery, earning himself the name ""SuperMan"" by the nurses who cared for him.    We were hopeful that this was a benign growth and now gone for good.  Hopefully he was one of the lucky ones.  Three weeks later on November 30th we received the earth shattering news that it was not benign but in fact a very aggressive and very malignant tumor.  Over the course of days we had a full diagnosis of Medulloblastoma.  An extremely rare cancerous (200 adult cases a year) brain tumor...which means we need to get aggressive treatment.  Johnny was able to be seen by the world renowned team at Memorial Sloan Kettering(MSK) in New York City and the planning started.  30  days of proton therapy with a 30 day ""rest period"" before starting 6 months of chemotherapy.  While the tumor is gone, it is so aggressive this  extreme therapy is needed to reduce the risk of reoccurrence.  The months ahead will include many days and nights away from home, side effects including hair loss, weight loss, vomiting and fatigue.  Johnny has traveled an hour each way for his proton therapy for over a month - Monday through Friday.  Now he will travel to NYC starting in March to be admitted to MSK to have a port placed for his chemotherapy to be infused through, he will keep this for at least two years.  He will then be readmitted for at least 3 days every month for treatment, with complications including blood transfusions and infections to be expected prolonging some of these stays.   Johnny has been out of work since November and will not be able to return until after his chemotherapy is complete in August.   As I mentioned before Johnny works on the radiation machines used to treat many types of cancers in several hospital in Southern/Central New Jersey.   In addition, Johnny is a proud Coastie!  He loved his weekends of training and with pride endured a year long deployment to Cuba.  Unfortunately, he struggles not only emotionally but financially due to the inability to participate in his reserve weekends.   With the lost of his income and the cost of deductibles, co-pays, gas money and hotel rooms to stay in NYC for his chemotherapy have been tremendous stressors.    Johnny continues to face challenges ahead but we are so grateful for the support of Memorial Sloan Kettering and the ability to receive care at one of the few centers in the world  that knows how to treat this tumor.  We ask for any help you can provide to allow Johnny to focus on getting healthy and fighting.  ANYTHING HELPS.

In 2017, she began experiencing frequent fatigue, nausea, headaches and body aches. Strange hives and rashes started popping up, then sleep problems emerged. Soon these issues became more frequent and more severe. She found herself in and out of doctor appointments for the next year +, taking many tests and ruling out a long list of possibilities. The search for the cause of her symptoms has seemed long and fruitless, and as more time passes her symptoms worsen. Her short commute to work has become a daunting task. Traveling to meet up with friends is now usually out of the question, as is attending band practices and events.

Our group will be working directly with the local orphanage to help accomplish the work needed there.We will be going out to the city to clean up and minister to local families in need with anything that they ask of.I will also go to my fathers city in Ukraine (called Vinnitsa) and go see where my father and his family were all born. In Vinnytsia we will go and see the fruits of the labor my uncle and father invested into when they helped create, organize, and sponsor an orphanage for the last 19 years. This is going to be an amazing opportunity for me and any monetarily help would be so great appreciated. Please keep me in yours prayers as I embark to go on a journey to see what God has planned for me.Thank you so much and may God bless all of you.",1551254400,1850,8,0,https://images.gofundme.com/s9bsDuIN0Lhao-aCDsWfythlgRY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36914442_1552777192232399_r.jpg,,1855,a man is standing next to a sign,nan,

We are asking for your charitable donations to help to purchase the paint, brushes, rollers, tarps and other painting supplies so we can accomplish our goal.

Her owner, Serena Costello, feared something was wrong with her beloved companion; she wouldn’t eat, she was lethargic and curled up in an unusual spot in the house which she wouldn’t move from. After hundreds of dollars of testing the vet found nothing wrong. Serena left for work and prayed she was just out of sorts. At 4pm, while sitting at her desk at the Radisson Hotel in New Rochelle she received a call from the Tuckahoe police department that Sadie had been found wandering the streets, barking and causing a stir. Sadie ran from the police, causing them to follow her on foot where she led them to a house; her house. The police found the porch door ajar and upon a closer look smelled gas. The police contacted con Edison and when they arrived they confirmed a natural gas leak in the basement. When Serena arrived home she found poor Sadie had been so determined to get out of the house that she ripped the peds off her feet trying to claw open the front door and the moldings. Miraculously she was able to chew through a portion of the framing of the sliding glass door and somehow open it to escape the house and then chewed through an exterior fence to get to the street. Serena and her 4 year old daughter Grace were saved by their amazing pet Sadie. Had Sadie not acted as she did, the house could have exploded with Serena and Grace inside. Clearly her behavior that morning indicated that she had known something was wrong from the beginning of the day. Our pets are truly incredible and this story, featured on ABC, NBC and Channel 12 has shocked everyone! But Sadie needs more vet visits to heal her feet and the house needs some TLC to repair the damage to the doors, fence, moldings, paint etc.... we are looking for your help to get this single mom and her daughter comfortable in their home again.

Everything was destroyed. She and her children, who each have special needs and require constant supervision, were able to make it out of the house without injury—something for which we are all unexplainably grateful.  Unfortunately, the home insurance does not offer temporary housing or content coverage.  Eventually, this little family will need to replace everything—but, as they currently dwell in their small hotel space, there isn’t enough room to house the donations rolling in.  **More to come regarding where to direct and what type of donations to make; please see email address below for ideas/questions about this** Right now what they MOST need is monetary assistance with their temporary lodging, finding more permanent/intermittent lodging, gas, and food from nearby restaurants (Trenton, GA area).  Cooking/food storage inside the hotel room is limited to a small microwave and mini-fridge. That said, money donated here to allow them to order or purchase food would be most helpful.  Some friends and family have paid the cost of the first several days of a wheelchair-accessible room for the four of them to stay, as is necessary to accommodate Vanessa’s limited range of mobility and electric wheelchair. Tomorrow, the next door, adjoining room has been added to their accommodations.  I’m asking you to help us—Vanessa’s friends and family—gather the funds to pay the next week, two weeks, month+ of lodging for her.

I am 16 years old and a sophomore in high school.  Thank you for taking your time to look at my profile.  I decided to start a Go Fund Me page because my mom and I need a little extra help to get me to ARTS International Orlando 2019.  In the beginning of the year I auditioned for an organization called ARTS International.  This is a family owned company who scouts for talent all around the world.   They hold two gathering annually where they bring in agents and managers from Broadway, Disney, Nickelodeon, International Commercial, Netflix, Hulu, Cartoon Network, and more to hire talent for their companies.          I was introduced to theatre when I was 7 and have been in numerous productions over the years.  I am also a self taught pianist.  Music means everything to me.  I believe music is concentrated emotions that the human mind cannot express into words.  To me, theatre is on an equal level to music, it allows me to pull the deepest of emotions from even the most stubborn of people.  And I'm good at it.  I am also a member of the International Thespian Society.        My mom has always tried to provide me with the best of everything.  She had me when she was 18 and raised me while being a single mother.   We've moved several times, each time for more opportunities.  When we moved to Kansas City, MO for a  job offer for my mom, (who is an amazing nurse), I started to learn that my true calling was theatre.  In the school I went to, I was introduced to debate and forensics. The forensics proportion of the team involved competitive acting.  I was able to gain several metals in the dramatic arts.  Soon after, I found out about ARTS International and auditioned.         My mom picked up a second job so that she could afford to send me to ARTS International.  I also picked up a job and have been doing fundraisers.  Even so, my mom and I are having trouble affording it.  We have been able to pay for a large majority of the cost, however, we are running out of time and realized we can't do it all on our own.  I have listed below the costs associated with going.  Please help me get to ARTS International showcase so I can express all of my emotions through theatre and help me take this burden off my mom so it can become a blessing.   How much does everything cost?  Attending fee - $2,000 Photo shoot for head-shots- $500  Head-shot prints $150  Hotel cost from July 2nd- July 8 at the Orlando World Center Marriott in Orlando, FL- $850 (we are sharing a room with another mother and daughter and splitting the total cost of the hotel stay; $850 is our half) Food for trip-$350  Clothing for trip- $300  Airfare - $650 Total - $4,800        My mom and I have already been able to pay $2,800 of our total fee, but we still have $2,000 to come up with in a few short weeks.  If there is anyway that you could help, and every penny counts, please help me achieve my dreams.  I love being on stage and entertaining, and I truly feel that this is what I am meant to do. ***If you have any more questions about ARTS International, you can visit their website at this link;    ",1558162800,2000,13,0,https://images.gofundme.com/JvDjhCZqKkjdHVBdHXuFxhPswA4=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36914260_155728611979214_r.jpeg,,330,a woman standing in front of a building holding a cell phone .,nan,

The night nears a close and we all say our goodbyes. That's when I go into my room to see a pint glass overturned on my brand new laptop. I then immediately pick it up and turned it over. A lot of water pours out.  Resisting the urge to cry out in horror, unplug the laptop and got as much of the water drained as I could. I then left it overturned over a vent to run air over it for the next two days.  How the water came to spill into my laptop was a bit of a mystery at first. I certainly didn't knock over the water glass, nor did I set the water glass there. Everyone who was with me are all old and trusted friends so I know none of them did it at least not on purpose and if they had accidentally knocked it over they would have at least told me.  A few days later, I figured out who the culprit was. My roommates super cute and fuzzy kitty cat. Since the incident, I have seen him knock over 3 full water glasses in 3 days.

510,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-susan-towers-amp-family,Susan Wright Towers & the Family of Tommy Parsons,Susan Towers is a mother of four who works at Publix grocery store in order to provide for her family.  Susan's oldest boy is named Tommy. Tommy was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when he was still a baby. About a month ago Tommy began coughing up major amounts of blood. He was taken to Tampa General hospital. They determined the bleeding was coming  from his left lung and that the upper lobe of his lung had actually died.  At Tampa General he under went 3 different embolization procedures within a 3 week period.  All of these were unsuccessful and he was still bleeding. Susan missed much work from her job during this time as she stayed many days and nights at the hospital with her boy.  She would watch over him while he slept and he would often wake up and start to cough and then lose more blood and have trouble breathing at the same time.  Very traumatic for everyone. A little over a week ago Tommy was sent to University of Florida. Last week they performed a lobectomy and they removed a part of his lung. As of today January 10th Tommy is still in the hospital recovering from the major surgery. He has not bled since surgery and is starting to get stronger and regain his color.

Our purpose is to introduce Mongolian culture, tradition, language, and history, promote closer educational relations between the United States of America and Mongolia, and encourage students and community members to be a part of the MCO. This year, we wanted to do something meaningful and special and bravely decided to organize The 1st Morin Khuur Festival in the USA.  The Morin Khuur, also known as “horse head fiddle”, is a traditional Mongolian instrument. It was first introduced and performed in the US in 1962, the year that Mongolia joined the United Nation. “Mongolian Traditional Music of the Morin Khuur” was proclaimed by UNESCO as one of the “Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity” in 2003 and inscribed in the “Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity” in 2008. Since then morin khuur became a world renowned musical instrument and foreign conservatories begun to teach morin khuur professionally. Therefore, it is essential to have an undertaking to further expand the growth and the artistic development of morin khuur.  Through this festival, we aspire to: promote Mongolian culture in the US; encourage everyone to further learn about morin khuur; evaluate the craftsmanship progress of modern morin khuur; introduce the history and evolution of playing techniques; and determine the vision for the future development. For more information about the event, please visit:    All the money donated to this campaign will go to the event operation, venue rentals, and guest accommodations.  We're so happy to let you know that the ""Mongolian Melody"" morin khuur concert, which is part of our festival activity, ticket is now officially on sale!

Mac has brought such joy and love to our son and family.  He is an excellent companion for our son, and brings happiness to anyone that encounters him. One night about a year ago, Mac began to act strangely. He was pacing, drinking excessively and was drooling. He could not get comfortable. He would lay down and get right back up and we let him outside thinking he needed to throw up or poop and no matter how hard he tried he just couldn't do it. He then would lay down in the snow which was very strange.  We brought him inside and he layed down to show my son his stomach and we noticed his stomach was swelling. My son and his girlfriend brought Mac to the Emergency Vet Clinic off hours because he was drastically declining. The veterinarian said that it was good that he brought him in when he did or he would not have made it the night. The vet told him after some X Ray images that he had GDV which basically means his stomach flipped and gas was building in his stomach and he needed emergency surgery. Both ends tied off like a balloon and if left untreated would be a very painful death. They told the vet they would proceed with surgery but the cost was over $4,500. My son is currently going to college and working, but is still struggling to cover this high medical bill cost. I was able to get the Care Credit Card to pay for the surgery and give my son the time to pay it back in payments. The bad thing is the card has to be paid off in 6 months or you accumulate all the interest. We just wanted Mac back in our lives, healthy and happy! Mac had the surgery and his recovery took sometime, but he did well. After a month, Mac was back, joyful and loving.  A year later Mac has been a joy to our family, until last night. My son called at 12:30 am, upset. He said Mac was acting odd, like when his stomach twisted. I encouraged him to bring him in. The emergency veterinarian clinic thought it might be his spleen that twisted or it could be a tumor. They charged my son $500 at that clinic and referred him to a clinic in the metropolitan area.  They admitted Mac and ran more ultrasounds. Findings, spleen became twisted. Surgery would need to be done, Mac had fluid in his abdomen. They gave him pain meds and provided my son an estimate of  just under$5,500. Mac is our family, we love him! We used the care credit card again! if there is a way to save him then why not do it?  He is a special dog! If you have a couple dollars to spare that could assist my son with paying off some of this, we would be grateful. Any donations would go towards the almost $10,000 of medical bills that have been accrued in the last year to keep Mac alive.",1547107200,5000,0,0,https://images.gofundme.com/KZ8CPCNKFqDx38a_DvenejmA2SQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085924_1547263270782820_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085924_1547154927910531_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085924_154715486137570_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085924_1547155237753128_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085924_1547138441311152_r.jpeg",850,a black dog with a red collar sitting on a couch .,nan,a black and white dog laying on a bed . a black and white dog laying on top of a bed . a black and white dog laying on a couch . a dog is looking out the window of a car .

I am also a first-year McGill University student pursuing a degree in psychology and neuroscience. I have spent my life cross country skiing at Nakkertok. I then joined Chelsea Nordiq Ski Club and became a biathlete. Biathlon is a unique sport, it demands intense skiing followed immediately with shooting a target the size of an Oreo from 50m. The mental piece is the biggest challenge. A good sense of humour helps. It has been a wonderful experience to have learned, trained and improved with the help of my amazing team and coaches Eric, Katie and Maurice. Now, I am thankful and honoured to have the opportunity to compete for Canada on February 25th, 2019 at the World University Games hosted in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, Russia. This would be my first international Biathlon competition. I have competed across Canada with the help of my parents. For example, I attended two national competitions and last year I won my first medal at the nationals. Ever since I started training for biathlon, I learned so many things such as hard work, dedication and perseverance as well as supporting each other as a team. It has truly been one of the best experiences I have had in my life. However, competing in biathlon at the World University Games is very expensive. The  approximate cost $5,500 covers travel, accommodations, race fees, food and coaching.  Your kind sponsorship, of any amount, would be greatly appreciated. In addition, I will create, for all donors, a narrative photo album from the games. Your donation will allow me to represent Canada as a biathlete at the World University Games.

Steve likes to play guitar and enjoys beer.  Steve is a friend of mine and former roommate of 3 years. He's a postal worker and this was a case of mistaken identity.  A strange man tapped on his window on New Years Eve day as he was delivering mail and fired at least 3 shots, hitting him in the back, chest, and arm. Steve, with the aid of neighbors, managed to get to the hospital before losing too much blood.  Steve underwent many hours of surgery and received some 40 units of blood as to not bleed to death. He's got a long road to recovery and will need help since he's missing work and with assisting with hospital bills. In 3-4 weeks when Steve is healed enough, he will start occupational therapy...   Steve was hit in an artery. He lost half of his blood and they gave him a blood transfusion. Steve managed to stay conscious all the way to the hospital but his blood pressure was so low he went blind. ( temporarily ) Steve also has nerve damage in his right arm and can’t move his right hand or wrist or elbow. He could be paralyzed indefinitely in his arm depending on how the nerves grow back. I've learned Steve is receiving   while he is out,  and is of course saying he doesn't need handouts because that's the kind of guy he is.  That being said, I feel like getting shot 3 times by a stranger is a horrible way to start the New Year. I just want to help him out and make this not so hard for him.  He was released to his own apartment yesterday after 9 days in the hospital to heal at home.  Please feel free to reach out to him and show your support.  I think helping Steve in this time will help restore a little bit of faith in humanity after a nut job shot him 3 times.

A large amount of cancer (seen by the doctor during surgery) has spread to the peritoneum just outside the pelvis, the intestine, and to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Maia had 6 chemo treatments done. Chemo treatment is physically and emotionally traumatic and taxing.  Her own experience with chemotherapy was an endless array of side effects that were painful and debilitating and also resulted in losing 25% of her body weight. This left her weak, barely being able to stand for more than a few minutes some days. The side effects became more intense and it seemed almost daily that there were new aspects to manage. Even if someone could have told and prepared her for the type of effects she might have to endure, she did not have the energy to fight and find peace within the struggle. There was pain, nausea, loss of appetite, nerve pain, bone pain, loss of nails, neuropathy, chemo-brain, coloring of her hands and feet, and a constant chemical taste in her mouth that ruined all food and drink. The waves of nerve pain traveling from her feet to her neck was truly excruciating and there was no remedy.  Nothing about chemo feels to her like it is a healing process. Unfortunately, at this time this is what her doctors are recommending. Due to the side effects of chemo treatment, she is unable to work.  I know that life gets hard at times.

Akhi's presence is always pleasant. Whether he's at Division Street or Dragonfly, if he's walking down Main Street, or even if he's just sitting on his front porch, he'll always give a friendly hello and maybe even challenge you to a game of chess. I would hate to see him get evicted, especially in this cold weather when he has no place to go. If I had the money I would do it myself, but the only thing I could think to do to help is to ask the community (his community) for help. Everything donated will go directly to him and even if the goal isn't met, maybe whatever we can raise will help him buy more time before he gets his next check next month. Akhi's presence in Somerville is alike to Stan Lee's presence in a Marvel movie. Maybe you haven't seen him in a while and asked yourself ""I wonder what Akhi's doing?"" But when he shows up, it's always a welcome and enjoyed time. I don't know what would happen should he get kicked out of his apartment, but he belongs in Somerville and I'm sure many locals would be sad to see him go. Everything is appreciated.

532,https://www.gofundme.com/f/mermaid-maggie,Mermaid Maggie,"The backstory. Three years ago Maggie Shemenski’s hands and feet started to contract. “They said it was sore muscles; I was working out too much,” Shemenski said. “They said I had Rheumatoid arthritis, and then they said I had Rhabdo and come to find out I didn’t have any of those things.” A medical mystery. Despite years of tests and treatments, doctors still haven’t been able to officially diagnose Maggie, but that hasn’t stopped her from living her life to the fullest. Maggie is a regular at the 6:00 AM class at CrossFit Pushin Weight in Powhatan, VA where she trains just as hard as she did before her medical issues began. ""She comes in day in and day out and does the work,” said owner Ashley Jenkins. “I'll do one workout with her the way that she does it and I don't think people understand what a true, true warrior she is."" And that’s why everyone at CrossFit Pushin Weight calls her #MermaidStrong. Another WOD entirely. ""When you're wearing hooks and you're doing it from your knees it's a different workout and it's a game changer,” Jenkins said. “You can understand how hard it is and the tenacity that she has."" Maggie placed second in the Adaptive/Seated division in the Wodapalooza online qualifier and today CrossFit Pushin Weight is hosting a fundraiser WOD to help get her there. And here’s the kicker, Maggie got to design the WOD. “They have to do it like I do and that’s the most exciting thing ever because you see all these able-bodied athletes doing things their way. Nobody really understands how I have to do it.”",1547107200,2000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/5RE4vzf4VrRKudTIHnTyOzuZ_D0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085612_154713525814503_r.jpeg,,2125,a woman in a red shirt is holding a cellphone,nan,

(Just promise not to tell him!) As you may or may not know, Keith is color deficient. It's different from being color blind and it just means that some colors are very hard for him to distinguish between. He describes what he sees as taking a digital image and turning the saturation way down. (I've tried it and it really does make it difficult to see the differences between colors.) If you're like me, your first thought might have been, ""Man, he needs those color correcting glasses!"" Well, friends, I'm glad you think so, too. I've wanted for years to give them to him, but they're just out of reach for me alone. So, let's do this! Let's work together and surprise him with a life-changing experience for his birthday this year! (Yes, yes, of COURSE I'll take video! DUH!!) Want to join in, but don't have much? I feel ya!

549,https://www.gofundme.com/f/cynthia039s-kidneys-help-my-mom,Cynthia's Kidneys - Help My Mom,"Here goes. My mom, Cynthia Canfield, is a loving, funny, incredibly strong single mother to myself and my younger sister. She has dedicated her life to caring for and supporting us on her own, but now it is her turn to be cared for. My mom has Poly-cystic Kidney Disease and is currently in  . Poly-cystic Kidney Disease is when cysts grow inside your kidneys and those cysts eventually become so large that kidney function is impaired and stops altogether. She has lived with this disease since her diagnosis in her 20's but it is only recently that she's taken a turn for the worse. Healthy people are at 100% kidney function;   This means her kidneys are only functioning at 11% of the normal rate. Her body cannot filter out the toxins in her blood and they build up, causing extreme fatigue, blood toxicity, extreme high blood pressure, and can cause damage to the heart, brain, liver, pancreas, and other organ tissue. She is already feeling the fatigue and pain that comes with this, and has not been able to work or leave the house in general nearly as much as she could even a month ago.      There is no way to reverse or slow down this disease. The recommended course of action is a kidney transplant, and until that can happen, to start dialysis. We were initially told (before she had gotten down to 11%) that she could live possibly up to 3-5 years before a transplant was necessary. Now, the timeline we are given is much, much shorter. She is going to do Peritoneal Dialysis, which is when a catheter is permanently inserted into the abdomen in order to fill/drain the body with a solution which will draw the toxins out of her blood, and do some of the job that her kidneys cannot. The dialysis will help, but nothing can in the way that a transplant could. As I type this, she is in surgery for the dialysis catheter to be placed. I sit in my car in the parking lot of the hospital trying to muster up every ounce of courage I have to type this out and ask for help. After this surgery, she will not be able to work for some time in order to heal, and even after healing she will not be able to work much as dialysis is not a ""cure"", but a band-aid. Urgently, this is what we need help with. As she is a single mom, all of the financial burden in our house and family of 3 falls on her. She is a massage therapist and we live paycheck to paycheck; I am a college student and am working 2 jobs in order to help us survive, but it will not be enough on its own. Her insurance is only covering a fraction of the surgery she's undergoing today, which makes us extremely worried for the transplant. We are left with a $1,500 hospital bill that we don't have the money for, the next month or so of rent, utilities, groceries and gas that she can't work to afford, and the knowledge that - much sooner than we'd initially expected - my mom will have to have a transplant that will be well over $200,000, be out of work for recovery afterwards, and take anti-rejection drugs which will total ~$17,000 a year for the rest of her life.      She is in the process of getting put on transplant lists for hospitals in our area, but I am going to get tested to see if I'm a match. If I can donate a kidney to her, I absolutely will. If I can not, she will have to wait on the list until she can get a viable kidney and continue on with dialysis. This whole process scares me to death because she is my mom, and we all believe our mothers are invincible until they suddenly aren't. To know my mother is to love her; she is a ray of sunshine in the lives of everyone around her. She is my best friend, my confidante, and the most important person in my life. For her sake, it is time to admit that we can't do this alone. If you can donate, literally  . If not, .  Help of any kind is tremendously appreciated. Thank you.",1547107200,100000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/_OhQN30CAW2mG9Y7rJRi3rrPUpE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085528_1547135981153768_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085528_1547162076406307_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085528_1547162152509262_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085528_1547160147604121_r.jpeg",2474,a couple of women standing next to each other .,nan,a group of people standing next to each other . a couple of women standing next to each other . a woman sitting at a table with a glass of wine .

But besides playing soccer, we plan to share meals with other teams, make friends, and take part in pool play. However, to make this happen, we need your help: Proceeds raised would help cover team-related expenses -- including coaching, equipment, lodging, and airfare -- as well as provide financial support to  *** ensure every member of our team can go regardless of economic situation *** So to make ALL of our dreams come true, please donate here - it is 100% tax-deductible and will make a huge difference to every member of our team.

AYSO’s goal is for kids and adults to play soccer. Each year we form new teams as evenly balanced as possible because providing a stronger learning experience for teams as they play teams comprised of similar ability. It also allows for each player to experience playing with a wide variety of teammates of different skill levels. AYSO requires they create a positive experience for every player in AYSO. A coach can be one of the most influential people in a player’s life, so encouraging player’s effort leads to greater enjoyment, improved skills and stronger motivation in players. We strive to create a positive environment based on mutual respect rather than a win-at-all-costs attitude, and our programs are designed to instill good sportsmanship in every facet of AYSO. All players should be able to develop their soccer skills and knowledge to the best of their abilities, both individually and as members of a team, to maximize their enjoyment of the game.",1548748800,20000,7,0,https://images.gofundme.com/HsZbKqu8CYyWjpByoT79ptQ4yG0=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085508_1548188353982302_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085508_1548777659361118_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36085508_1548777691687430_r.jpeg",1740,a group of people standing next to each other .,nan,a group of people standing next to each other . a group of young people standing next to each other .
553,https://www.gofundme.com/f/pvcve-medical-and-lost-wages,Medical and Lost Wages,"On Monday, January 7th, 2019, I recieved a call from an ER doctor and found out that Jason had a massive heart attack while he was at work. They had to shock and resuscitate three times because Jason went into cardiac arrest. The doctors immediately took him back to cath lab to place a stent in his LAD artery (the widow maker) of his heart due to some plaque that ruptured, causing blood clots, thus causing the heart attack. From there, Jason spent 3 days in the intensive care unit being monitored very closely in case another heart attack should happen. Only about 50% of people who have a heart attack from this artery live... so Jason is very lucky to still be here, he's 40 years old and unfortunately has a genetic predisposition when it comes to heart disease. Unfortunately, my medical insurance likely will not pay for any of the costs that were endured with this very serious situation because it's a new year and with a family our insurance deductible is $5000.00 before they will cover anything except preventative appointments and medications. Not only that, but Jason's heart is only functioning at 35-40%, so he is unable to work and will not be able to work for some time.  We have two children and ourselves to support and my income alone will not cover the cost of living for all of us. If anyone can donate to help offset the cost of the medical bills and cost of living, we would greatly appreciate it, anything helps.

558,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-leigh-medical-expenses,Help Leigh with Medical Expenses!,"Hi everyone! My name is Leigh, and I'm a 30 year old disabled Canadian trans man. I've had back pain my entire life. It was always made out to be normal, because 'everyone has back pain'. I've never been able to sleep on my back, despite it supposedly being better for your back. As it turns out there were several significant explanations for why I was hurting so much. I have 15 degree scoliosis in my lower back due to my right leg being 2cm shorter than my left. This has been well managed in the last year by my custom orthotic shoe inserts, without which I would no longer be able to walk for the soul-crushing back pain this discrepancy was causing.  However, I also have a 15 degree curve in my thoracic spine, arthritis in my hips, knees, and feet, very weak knee joints due to repeated sprains, and iliosacral dysfunction due to several very hard falls and strains in my old job as a veterinary technician, and in my brief stint in Roller Derby. Additionally, my cervical spine has an inverted curve, and I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back, as well as frequent muscle spasms throughout my back and neck. Altogether this has led to my daily life being anywhere from mildly to severely painful, and standing/walking for any extended period is painful and exhausting. I've been using a cane fairly regularly for the last year, which has helped insofar as making myself visible and encouraging people to let me sit in the bus and metro (this doesn't always work though). I got a rollator used on Kijiji for $50, which helped significantly but is still not enough since walking is still painful and exhausting, and the rollator is heavy and difficult to heave onto a bus (drivers rarely lower the wheelchair ramp for a rollator wielded by someone my age), and few metro stations have elevators so I have to cart it up and down stairs anyway. Due to all this, I bought a used wheelchair for $200 on Kijiji, which was almost the perfect solution. Having the chair helped my back and let me go about my day without pain. But, unfortunately, the chair is too small and not at all outfitted for Canadian winters. To bring the chair up to speed would cost more than buying a new chair, and that's obviously not a practical solution considering the size issue cannot be fixed. Yesterday, I got a full price quote for a custom chair from Maison Andre Viger Verdun for a Motion Composites Apex with a Freewheel attachment. This chair would cost $4290, plus $700 for the Freewheel. This chair would be tailored to fit me, outfitted for Canadian winters, AND weigh only 10lb. This would be the perfect solution for my needs. If you can, I would dearly appreciate the help with acquiring this much needed mobility aid. My pain will make my new university career at Concordia very difficult, and I want to be able to dedicate all my energy to my goal of becoming an occupational therapist or social worker for disabled kids at the Mackay Center in Montreal. If you can't donate, please share this everywhere you can as I desperately need this chair.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask and I'll do my best to clarify in updates.   Thank you!

In 2016 Joseph Murphy, Army National Guard veteran, took his own life. He was 23 years old.  During that 40 year span, Bob and Andrea Howe have been helping veterans and first responders experience the naturally therapeutic power of the wilderness.  Pine Grove Programs is working with Joe Murphy’s family to build a Suicide Awareness Cabin in Joe’s honor. They want to raise awareness and provide a welcoming place for service members, and their families, who are struggling with trauma, potentially saving a family from the devastation and pain of suicide. A portion of the costs have already been raised with local events and donations from Joseph’s friends, family, and the many supporters of Pine Grove Programs. We are asking for help to finish this cabin and make the dream a reality.  Any amount will go far. We see this as an opportunity for everyone in our community of veterans, service members, and supporters to fund this effort as a team. Much like the cabin, we can build this bit by bit! $45,000 will go towards the remaining cost of the Suicide Awareness Cabin Project, estimated breakdown below:  Building Materials and Permits - $30,500 Interior furniture/fixtures/finishing - $10,000 Promotional Campaign, Fundraising and Production of Trailer - $4,500 The additional $25,000 of this campaign will allow us to create awareness to let Veterans and First Responders throughout the United States know about the services available to them through the Pine Grove Program. Should we exceed our goal of $70,000, additional funds will be used to provide outdoor adventures at no cost to more veterans, first responders, and Gold Star Families. More about Pine Grove Programs: Bob and his wife Andrea bought Pine Grove Lodge & Cabins back in 1998. Having some empty rooms and an open heart, they started giving away lodging and guide service to veterans and first responders to man-made and natural disasters.  As the program grew, they formed a separate entity called Pine Grove Programs which is a licensed 501(c)3.  All the proceeds from fundraising efforts are used to help veterans and first responders. No salaries are paid to the Howe’s, board members, or any others involved parties.  The Howes and their many wonderful volunteers pour their hearts and souls into every detail. They create healing outdoor experiences through hiking, fishing, hunting, kayaking, gold panning, canoeing, and more for the men and women who sacrifice family, mental health, emotional well-being, and their lives for our country and communities.  All Pine Grove Programs’ services and activities are offered at no cost to attendees. Beautiful lodging, home cooked meals, and a custom experience in the Maine wilderness provide time for families to heal, bond, and create new memories.

This is terminal and she needs a new kidney because of it.  I met Diane in 2016 when I started dating her one and only child, Joe,When i met her it was an instant love, she took me into her home and treated me like shes known me for years. She hugged me and told me how beautiful i was and introduced me to some of the people she loves the most. Diane would give you the shirt off her back and would help you in anyway she could. Diane just had a fistula done for dialysis but as many know, dialysis is not a cure, but only a treatment. It's true that it may help prolong life. Not by much, though. Regardless, she would still absolutely need a new kidney. she does have insurance but insurance has premiums and co-pays that she needs help with. Getting a new kidney is only one obstacule the other is how to pay for a transplant. Her insurance will only cover so much and we have to come up with the rest, for the fistula she had to pay 1200$ imagine what a transplant will cost. Diane, Joe and I all currently live together.We help each other out the best we can. And, as stated before, Diane is always one to help anyone she can. Hopefully, a few kind hearted souls would be willing to give back and help her to fully and truly become well again.

She is one of the dearest and truly impressive people I know. She works full time for a school in Minnesota, and on her nights and weekends she writes, illustrates, and produces her own art and comic books. Due to recent circumstances she could use our help.  Doctors are working with Ashley to determine the cause of her debilitating migraines. They are trying different treatments, and tests to see if they can identify the cause of the migraines. In the meantime these same migraines are causing Ashley to miss work, become disoriented and unable to drive, robbing her of a healthy night’s sleep, and the related medical bills are piling up.  Ashley's medical insurance is a high deductible plan, thus leaving her with the majority of the balance of her visits as her responsibility to pay. In true Ashley fashion she has pushed herself to work through her migraines as best she can, and solicited her artistic skills for private commissions to raise money to pay for her medical bills. She isn't one to ask for help, so instead she has worked toward her own solution. Her commissions are still available, and I highly encourage you to contact her if you would like to. I know she would much rather have people purchase her art, or products, than simply receiving handouts.  Nonetheless, Ashley needs help. Her medical bills increase with each visit, and there is no sign of those visits stopping any time soon. This is why I am asking for your assistance on her behalf.  Any money donated will be applied towards Ashley's financial needs, paying down her medical bills to whatever extent we can.  On top of donations, I too am offering illustration commissions for purchase, with the profits of those commissions also being applied towards Ashley's needs.  Please consider donating, or contacting us via the links below for details on how to order an art commission. We need to raise as much money as we can, as quickly as we can, so that the pressure of the medical bills is relieved, thus allowing Ashley and her family the ability to focus on healing and finding a solution.

A ""perfect storm"" of influences occur, and we find ourselves in a challenge. It happens to almost everyone at one time or another, right? That's what has happened to our dear friend Sharon and her sweet Stella. Sharon has worked for years as a personal care attendant to senior adults. She is an independent contractor.  Her most recent client took a turn for the worse and is now needing residential care in a nursing home. Typically, Sharon would be able to find a new client quickly through referrals or would do agency work until a permanent client was identified. That's what she was planning. But, another challenge has presented itself. Sharon is dealing with severe varicose veins in one of her legs. She is working with a provider to have the condition corrected, and the procedure is scheduled . . . in February. Sharon thought the procedure was next Monday, but was told yesterday that it is delayed until next month. She has been advised that once they have completed the in-office procedure, there is nearly immediate relief and she will be able to work. But  she isn't allowed to take a new client from an agency until she is cleared. All that said, there is a gap between her last paycheck from the previous client and when she will be able to work and be compensated. When she an I spoke on Sunday, she was optimistic that the procedure would be accomplished and she would be back to cash flow. I told her to please ask for what she needed. And she has asked. So, I'm asking all of my friends, and especially my friends who know and love Sharon and Stella, to help. We can easily raise $5000 not only to help her in the gap, but also to help with the medical bills and to give her a nice cushion as she moves into her next opportunity. (And don't forget, doggie treats aren't cheap!) Please contribute now! She needs the money today and going forward! Thanks. I must add that asking for what we need is hard. It's something I work on with clients nearly every day. Most can't. I'm so proud of Sharon that she took me at my word that we would help if she asked.

She was very yellow and was very sick.  Figuring it had something to do with her liver.  That was not the case.  She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that night.  We were all shocked since there were no signs.  She was admitted to the hospital and the next day she had surgery to place a stent in the tumor that was located in the pancreas head, this was to allow the bilirubin (bile) that had backed up into her body to start filtering thru her properly.  While she was in the hospital recovering from this surgery we applied for EVERY possible help for her, she is retired and lives on Social Security.  She also worked a second job delivering food to supplement her income because her Social Security did not cover all her expenses for a month.  She was denied cash assistance, Medicaid and Food stamps because the GOVERNMENTAL ENITY that decides said she made to much money from her retirement to get ANY help from the State of Colorado, and that because she was over 65 she does not qualify for any of the Medicaid assistance programs.   This women has worked her whole life, paid into all the systems, now she is 70, has pancreatic cancer, will have to go through Whipple Surgery, Chemo and Radiation to fight this cancer and the State of Colorado that she has paid taxes to for 50 years will not help supplement her income so she can stay in her home, feed herself and pay all the medical bills.  We have also submitted for assistance from the American Cancer Society but the assistance they provide financially is small and can only be provided 1-2 times for her lifetime.  We decided to start a GoFundMe so we can help our Mom with her medical bills and monthly expenses that are not covered by her retirement payment from Social Security.

For those of you who know her, you know that she is an extraordinary human being.  She is cheerful, loving, unbelievably strong and always puts her friends and family before herself.  Stephanie underwent surgery in November to have her appendix removed. With further testing cancerous cells were detected in her abdomen. She was diagnosed with stage 3 appendix cancer (low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm). This type of cancer is a mucin secreting tumor and it ruptured causing tumor cells to spread into her abdomen and those cells now are implementing on other organs causing more tumors. The formation of the mucin in the abdomen is a secondary cancer called PMP pseudomyxoma peritonei.  As a result, she will be having to undergo MAJOR surgery known as a HIPEC, this surgery includes cutting her from her sternum down to her pelvis to take out pieces of organs or possibly the entire organ if the cancer has gotten to it and possibly a total hysterectomy. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing for sure what all will be removed until the surgeons are looking inside of her abdomen.  After removal then surgeons will then infuse 110F hot chemo into her abdomen for 90min. The whole surgery will take around 9 hours. This surgery has required her to fly to Houston, Texas to endure a long stay at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Stephanie chose this specific hospital because MD Anderson specializes in this rare type of cancer and the cure rate was by far the best at this hospital in comparison to others.  Because of this, she will likely not be able to return to work for a few months. Short term disability unfortunately does not provide full pay. Her deductible is over $6,000 and some of her medical expenses are not covered, family flights to and from Texas plus hotel stays are not reimbursed at 100% and with the everyday necessities of life, money is getting tighter and tighter.   Stephanie is one of the strongest, most selfless people I have ever known and is always there to give her love and support or the shirt off her back to anyone that needs it.    Now, it's time that we send back some of that love and support to Stephanie.  Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated. Everything we can do to help and surround her with love is what is most important so she can focus on beating this thing. Please spread the word.

Tragically, after just one day home, he was rushed back to the hospital where he passed away. The world has lost a truly special man. Jose was a thoughtful son, and a loving big brother to his sister, Rose. Most importantly, he was a dedicated father to his son, Paul and a grandfather to his precious Aubrey.  Years ago, his family suffered the loss of his younger brother, Paul and their loving father, and during that difficult time Jose was the rock of his family and continued to be a pillar of strength and support.　 He was also a mentor to many! He was incredibly generous and kind, and his love for life and people was apparent. His genuine smile brought happiness to the people around him. Always, he aimed to improve himself and he gave encouragement to others to be the best version of themselves.　 Jose comes from a family deeply rooted in Christ Jesus. His mother Amelia, a prayer warrior, led him to Christ. Since then, he chose to live his life with the purpose of serving the Lord. He read his Bible consistently and was always faithful to tithe. He inspired many with his faith as he trusted in God for everything. His positive outlook on life and in business came from his deep love to the Lord. It was in Jose’s character to accept with grace all blessings and challenges in life as part of God’s perfect plan. His dedication and loving spirit will be greatly missed by all of us, and his mother, sister and son's life will never be the same without him. His mother, his sister Rose, and his son Paul would like to thank you, and everyone for the outpour of love shared through phone calls, text messages and social media posts.

I recently received a $750 scholarship to apply toward the program cost and tuition but I am still responsible for airfare, meals, and any academic supplies needed while abroad. I have created this campaign to reach out to my family, friends, mentors, and anyone else to ask for any support you might be able to provide me. If you are able to donate, I would appreciate even $1 to go toward this once in a lifetime experience. If you are unable to donate, I would love for you to just share my campaign to get the word out. I will also be open to babysitting or other odd-jobs for which I will receive payment via this campaign so all funds with go toward my program costs. If I am unable to raise the fund necessary to attend, all donations will be returned.

Our smallest dog, Gigi was violently attacked in our absence by one of our other dogs. She succumbed to serious muscle and tissue loss in her neck due to severe trauma. After two days in the ICU, she finally stabilized and had surgery to put her neck back together. She is unable to eat on her own and has a long recovery ahead of her. To ensure Gigi’s safety and the safety of our other pets and family, we had to make the heartbreaking decision to put down our other dog Miley of nine years.

She was a young, hard-working mom of a 2-year-old and spent over a year completing all recommended treatments including chemotherapy, radiation, and a mastectomy.  Despite routine mammograms and completing the standard treatment for breast cancer, we learned in January 2019 that cancer has returned to her body.   Jacquelyn, now 29 years old, was given the devastating news that cancer has spread throughout her body.  Recent PET scans show lesions in her breast, liver, bones, and brain making it a metastatic Stage 4 diagnosis.  This has resulted in several doctors appointments, scans and biopsies, an unexpected ambulance ride and ICU hospital stay, an outpatient surgery, and cancer treatments all in the last three weeks.   Although we don't want Jacquelyn to have to go through this again and are crushed by the news, we choose to believe in miracles and have faith in God's ability to heal. Because of the recent events, Jacquelyn has had to take a leave of absence from work to focus on her health at this time.  Her husband Seth is trying to be with her as much as possible while they raise their 5-year-old daughter together.   Jacquelyn is currently undergoing treatments of chemotherapy and radiation and every donation will help to relieve the financial burden of these treatments. Please donate to financially support Jacquelyn and her family at this difficult time as she battles cancer again!",1549526400,30000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/AkNhOZPE3tomd5j9HiECGOKySlg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913810_1549595436320986_r.jpeg,,35300,a young girl is holding a teddy bear .,nan,

Im trying to do the best for my son as the other party is a ex-con and an associated gang member. I have an amazing family of four, and my oldest son is the happiness of our home. Sebastian is four years old a very smart, happy boy, who loves his little brother so much. Ive filed for divorce and custody here in Albuquerque NM and the other party has filed in San Diego CA which has forced me to get 2 lawyers. Financially not in the best spot, im the only one working, just had another beautiful son with an amazing woman, and while paying for school. Timing couldn't of been worse and with the other party filing in CA and not wanting to cooperate has put me in a bad financial position needing 2 lawyers. As I grew up without a father im just trying to do the right thing and do everything to keep my son safe, healthy, and happy. Now it is a long story and you would like to know more im an open book and feel free to contact me. More people have been asking for more info. I meet the other party in high school, lived with her and her family for about 3 years and seen some things that cant be unseen. Fast foward to beginning of 2015, I was a stay at home dad raising my son while she went to work. She would come home from work get ready and go out with her friends till 2 or 3 in the morning, 2 weeks of this and I moved to my moms house with my son. After talking it out my son and I moved back in. Feb 17 2015, it was midnight while i waited for her to come back home. I heard i tow truck in the alley, and something told me to check it out, got out to the street and found my car getting dropped off bye a tow truck, meanwhile shes telling her friends bye and proceeds to kiss her boyfriend good bye not knowing i was watching everything. I confronted the two, she told me to calm down etc... He jumped into his brother car, and his brother tried to run me over twice hit me on second attempt. Next day i went to the house to pick up the rest of my belongings, and her boyfriend was right there. Now i was really just so lost and confused about why i was in this spot so i had to get away to my stepmoms house in Albuquerque NM. A week of being in Albuquerque i get a call from other party saying ""COME GET YOUR SON I CANT HANDLE IT ANYMORE!"" So next day my stepmom and i take a trip down to san diego to go pick up my son. Once we got him he was really sick from an ear infection and had a fever. I dont know about anybody else but my kids are my world and i would never give up on them. So it was my son and i living with my stepmom at the time, and then i found the most amazing woman of my life, and i started working just getting my life on track. Now i had my stepmom babysit my son while i was at work and my girlfriend was at work. Jun 2 2015 2 days before my birthday the other party randomly comes and moves to Albuquerque, starts living with my stepmom which keep me at my girlfriends house. A couple weeks of living here she starts to date my step brother, trying to tell me that he is his dad now. NOT COOL. Some months go bye with my son going back and forth from my place and my stepmoms place where my stepbrotber and her were staying. Then she told me she was planning on a trip to San Diego so my son could see some family, sounded like a alright idea which my mom hasnt seen my son in months. She told me that she had a plane ticket to go and come back already, which was fine to me they be back in 2 weeks. 2 weeks goes bye i ask her wernt you guys supposed to be on Albuquerque already? Then she informed me that she lied about the plane ticket back that she only had a one way, and that she was already looking for a job in San Diego. I asked her let me go pick him up and you can come back to Albuquerque once you can, she totally shot me down and told me i wasnt gonna take him. Now going back and forth with her for 2 years trying to see my son get time with him here. I even took a road trip all the way to San Diego to pick him up for 2 weeks and bring him back. She told me no once i got into town told me he could only go if i bought a plane ticket for her to go pick him up in 2 weeks, so i proceeded in getting the plane ticket just for her to tell me no again. Long story short i went all the way to san Diego not to see my son. Now she started getting in trouble with the law she got locked up for grandtheft auto and stealing people identity, she was facing 5 years in prison. As soon i found out she was incarcerated i drove down to san diego to pick up my son from his grandparents, where i was informed BYE HER OWN PARENTS that he wasnt even with her that the grandparents were rasing him and that she was out partying every nite drinking and doing drugs. Has never called her mom but bye her nickname. She got realesed at the end of 2018 in which in time i filed for divorce and custody here in Albuquerque. Had contact with her trying to get info from her to get her served, never gave me any info even asked her family for help nothing. Until i get divorce and custody papers from san diego now. So she was not willing to work with me to get served and turned around and filed herself thats not right. So now in the situation on getting 2 lawyers here in Albuquerque and San Diego. And being a complicated case and in 2 different states im needed good lawyers to get this done and to keep my son where he needs to be, not wanting to take any chances. A little about me im a college graduate with an associates degree in automotive engineering, i have a great career, a 3 bedroom house which my son has his own room and the extra for my mom, i have a reliable car. Im just in a financial slump right now trying to pay for the house i have and paying back school with me only working. Im a loving father just trying to make the best for my kids.

I was kicked out of home when I was 18, in the middle of my first year university exams, with only a casual job at a fast food chain with little to no employment benefits to fall on. I took with me my Cat, Tolken, who was my only comfort. He means so much to me, initially I adopted him as a way to get me through my final year at high school, yet I found it incredibly difficult to look after him when he needed me the most because of my financial insecurity. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression later on in an effort to help my university career and get the help that I needed after the traumatic family breakup in 2017.  Despite moving on with better career alternatives, the business itself couldn't afford to keep me on the hours I needed, and this month, again exam season, has been the hardest one yet, as my roommates have decided to move out, causing immense financial stress as I try to save up for my own move due to an inability to afford the increased monthly rent. On the night of the exam, Tolken became incredibly sick. At only 3 years old, he was experiencing a life threatening condition that quickly escalated during the night, causing immense stress for me and for him. I rushed him to the emergency vet department, knowing that the diagnosis, treatable or not, could mean I would lose my cat because of my lack of finances. He has been my best friend and only comfort since being rejected by my parents, and the thought of losing him because I couldn't afford basic pet insurance was and still is a horrible thing to think about.  Then comes Sean. My boyfriend. He has helped me buy groceries when I couldn't afford to eat, he has been understanding when I needed it the most, and he has been there for me when my parents weren't. On the night I thought I'd lose my Cat, Sean was there to help me carry him into the vets office. When the vet assess the diagnosis, she announced that whilst he was treatable, it was incredibly costly. Anywhere between 3000-5000 dollars. Without a second thought, Sean said we'd pay. Or rather, he'd pay for me, eliminating the option of letting Tolken Die.  The catch? He used the money he'd saved for a trip to Japan in June.  That, and he saved a cat he's both allergic to, and he doesn't even like cats. Yet, he's always treated Tolken with respect, sneezing be damned.",1549526400,5000,6,0,https://images.gofundme.com/_R0L7R1bHLqKUq5SiDcZginYRMM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913724_1549595364148860_r.jpeg,,705,a man in a suit and tie holding a glass of wine .,nan,

623,https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-memorial-for-jeremy,A Memorial for Jeremy,"A Memorial for Jeremy I have heard directly and from others how many people had wanted to come for Jeremy’s wake and funeral but were unable to for many reasons.  When someone we love and cherish passes away, we often look for a way to memorialize that person.  I’d like to offer two ideas on how to memorialize Jeremy.  There are many other beautiful ways, but I present to you these.  One way is with the memorial headstone at his grave. As I ponder the details of Jeremy’s memorial headstone, I think of some options of what I can have written on it; Beloved Son, Beloved Brother, etc.  I realize this only tells a part of his story.  Jeremy does not just belong to me and his biological family.  He had so many “families”; his girlfriend, his close friends in New York, his close friends in Florida, his military family, his work-families.  Jeremy was truly loved by so many! He did not just belong to me.  So I’d like to invite you to contribute to his memorial stone.  Be assured, I do have the money to do this on my own but I thought you, his family “without borders” might like to be a part of Jeremy’s permanent memorial.  The headstone will run about $2,500.  My thoughts at this point would be to include, in addition to his name and important dates, the Marine emblem, some mountains, an Irish (celtic) cross, and a Scripture quote about friendship.  He chose to be friends with family and friends alike.     I will absolutely make up the difference from what we raise to the final cost.  This isn’t about needing money for the stone but a desire to allow others to be a part of his final memorial.  If we run over, I will donate the remainder to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Another option to memorialize Jeremy is to contribute directly to a fundraiser for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in Jeremy’s name.  This is being run by Jeremy’s Aunt Tricia.    Here is the link for those who would like to participate in this.   This fundraiser is being run by Jeremy's sisters,  Jean Youngman & Carrie Decker, you can feel free to contact us.",1552118400,2500,5,0,https://images.gofundme.com/w3tOLX54cz878zkmQhjS09iwzRE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37644502_1552184823760419_r.jpeg,,2000,a man in a suit and tie is smiling .,nan,

628,https://www.gofundme.com/f/creativity-community-center,Creativity Community Center,"Campaign Creativity Community Center   The Backstory It began 10 years ago with a small group of dedicated mothers in Minneapolis, Minnesota who set out to fill a need for the Muslim youth in their community. Mothers who took it upon themselves to create a supportive environment to educate and nurture these children in the prophetic tradition as well as knowledge and application of the Arabic language.   Fast forward 10 years, Alibdaa School, or Creativity School, has become a leader among established Arabic Sunday schools in Minnesota with over 100 students across 9 grades and a waiting list. The school has earned its reputation for its commitment to strong academic standards in Qur’an, Islamic studies and Arabic literacy. With a specialized and trained group of volunteers the school has also lived up to its name by fostering creative outlets for its students through talent shows and theatrical plays that promote family and communal values.   Alhamdulillah, all praise is due to Allah, the quality of the student experience at Alibdaa School has attracted so many families from every direction in Minnesota. Some of our families drive more than 3 hours round trip to be part of the Alibdaa’s legacy.  That reflects a very important and rapidly growing need so many of our Muslim families have; a place to help nurture and inspire generations of young Muslims toward the pursuit of faith and excellence through creativity, morality and leadership.   Alibdaa School is a not-for-profit organization run by the tireless efforts of a group volunteer teachers and staff, it currently operates inside a small masjid in the south of Minneapolis and the size of our current facility has been a tremendous constraint on our growth and operation. We need to cater to the unmet needs of those children on the waiting list, expand with our growing generation beyond the 9th grade and broaden our holistic Islamic approach beyond the classroom to raise exemplary generations of Muslims in America.   How Can You Help?   The Creativity Community Center is seeking your support to join in our Creativity Community Center campaign, so please support our efforts to build upon our existing funds to purchase a property that will allow us to extend and expand our current services to the Muslim and wider community at large. An investment in our project includes providing our Muslim youth and their families with a space in which they can be inspired by the Islamic tradition toward personal and communal achievements. A space where talents, passions, curiosities and aspirations are cultivated and realized for all members of our families.   It is our hope that the purchasing of a suitable property will allow us to expand our services to the community in a more comprehensive way including:   ·                     larger classrooms ·                     the addition of adult classes and weekday/evening classes ·                     a large prayer area ·                     a banquet room ·                     both indoor and outdoor play areas ·                     a kitchen ·                     a gym   With your support we aspire to fill this important need for our community and to support our youth in their connection with their Deen and with each other. Our goal is that their appreciation and implementation of their faith in all aspects of their life is seamless and meaningful.   No support is insignificant or too small. Each dollar you donate in this project is an investment in future generations and will count as sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity) for you, and each piece of the building you helped to secure will testify for you on the Day of Judgment.

Diagnosed in second grade with a inoperable brain tumor, he has had many surgeries and backfalls along the way.  Matthew ""Brian"" fell unconscious for unknown medical reasons in early February and was found 5 days later. He was in a coma for many days while doctors quickly worked to control his many medical conditions including brain swelling, pneumonia and his blood sugar. The doctors have been very successful at reducing the fluid in his brain and around his tumor and HE'S AWAKE!  Brian has begun the long road to recovery, learning how to walk, talk and use his extremities again.  He has been so blessed by the team of doctors and family to have round the clock care here in Missouri and it's now time for some extreme help.   Brian's family had taken off work to care for him,  but they need to get home, with Brian.   His mother and father Anne and David must return to work along with his father Rick which is in Texas.  Brian needs long term care in a rehabilitation center and needs the help of family daily.   In order for this to happen,  he needs to fly back to Texas with medical staff and all his very much needed medical equipment,  which is not covered by insurance due to the extensive medical equipment and staff required to be with him during his travels.  They are looking into charities and help from every angle possible, yet the just isn't much time and frankly they won't keep Brian forever. To fly him home to Texas will cost 15 grand,  and again is not being covered by insurance.  Leaving it up to family and friends to spread the word and help raise money to bring him home to Texas, to his family and his son Seth.

642,https://www.gofundme.com/f/ivf-fund-for-baby-lujan,IVF Fund for Baby Lujan,"Hello family, friends, and whomever else may come across this, we are John and Nikki Lujan. I'm going to give you the short version, of our very long, emotional backstory.  We have been married for 12 and a half years. During that time we have been pregnant 4 times, unfortunately each of those pregnancies ended in loss for us. Two of which were ectopic, sending my wife, Nikki, into emergency surgery. Our first pregnancy occured in March of 2007 and we were so excited, but about 8 weeks something wasn't right. The doctor determined that it was an ectopic pregnancy and she was taken into surgery. This was rough on both of us, and I was getting ready to leave for basic training for the Army, so we took a break on trying for the time. I was deployed almost immediately after basic training, but returned home from my deployment in November of 2008. By late January of 2009 we were pregnant again, but in March found out that Nikki was miscarrying the baby. We waited the 3 months we were told her body needed before trying again, but we were determined. We found out at the end of September 2009 that we were again pregnant. Third times a charm, right? Not for us, in November 2009 we found out this baby was being miscarried as well. That brings us to December of 2011, we were pregnant again! Nikki was extremely sick with this pregnancy, which led us to hope this time would be different. Except it wasn't. Nikki began to experience a pain that was all too familiar, but much worse. She was taken to the ER via ambulance and it was determined this pregnancy was also ectopic, but the tube had burst. We experienced the loss of our last pregnancy February 17th 2012, which left Nikki with just one fallopian tube, and a true emotional/spiritual mess, but she pushed through, we pushed through. We tried for another for over a year, with no luck, so in the fall of 2013 the testing began, not only for Nikki but for myself too. After testing, it was determined that Nikki's remaining fallopian tube was blocked. We were told that surgery could fix this, but surgery did not go as planned. The doctor informed us afterwards, that her remaining tube was unable to be unblocked, and IVF (in vitro fertilization) was our only option for having a biological child of our own.  We talked, and Nikki decided she needed to take a break. This news, mixed with losing 4 pregnancies in 5 years had just been too hard on her emotionally, spiritually, and physically, so we did not proceed. Fast forward...It's now 2019 and we have decided it's time to try again, at least one more time, for Baby Lujan. IVF is very expensive, so we're humbling ourselves, and asking for your help to have a baby. We are seeking  your help in the way of financial donations and prayers. We would like to thank everyone in advance for any donation you are able to give, no matter how small, every little bit will help.  Thank you,  John and Nikki Lujan",1552118400,8000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/6_3hd8LzjqkXzZEzPfwJekz1XTs=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37644238_1552657154573161_r.jpg,,510,a man in a suit and tie holding a baby .,nan,

659,https://www.gofundme.com/f/over-the-roof,Over the Roof,"Luke Grabeman is our high school History Teacher at Meadowbrook Academy (Stokes County School System) in King, North Carolina. He is married to wife, Courtney, and has a young son, Samuel. Luke has also served as a sports coach for other schools in our system, and has always given back to this community. Luke’s entire family is public servants in the Stokes County School System. Luke has been battling issues with his back for the past seven or eight years. From late spring through early summer of 2018, in an eight week period, Luke had three MRI's, with contrast injections, to assist his doctors/surgeons in determining his best surgical strategy to repair his back injuries. Luke’s back surgery was completed in late summer, and he appeared on the road to recovery. In a very short time frame, following Luke’s surgery, he began experiencing acute/chronic symptoms/reactions that were not normal to the particular back surgery that he had. After many trips to many specialists, and extensive research and testing, Luke has been identified as having Gadolinium Toxicity, a condition in which his body has retained extremely high amounts of Gadolinium (an element in the contrast injections used in MRIs), This heavy metal essentially causes a neurological system malfunction in the human body. Luke cannot feel his extremities.  He feels as though he has “brain fog” constantly. He is having severe head pressure, and feels “out of his body” and “out of his head” most of the time.  He also has swelling on his brain.  He suffers from excruciating bone and joint pain, uncontrollable muscle spasms, intense body burning, and horrible muscle weakness. Luke’s numbers, for what is considered to be normal kidney (renal) function, are “over the roof” high, as well. There has been very little research/development done on this particular condition; therefore, according to the medical community at large, this condition does not exist, at least on paper. As such, his treatments are not covered by insurance. Luke is paying for all treatments, travel to/from treatments, lodging, food, etc., out of his own pocket. He is currently traveling from King, NC to Chapel Hill, NC and Hilton Head, SC weekly for treatments. Chelation, the name of the treatment, is a two-day ordeal: on day one, Luke receives the Chelation, which binds to the metals in his soft tissue, hopefully processing them to remove them from his body. On day two, Luke is given a vitamin and mineral treatment to counteract the negative effects of the previous day’s treatment. These treatments alone cost between $500-$1,000 per visit. Additionally, Luke has spent $3,800 on a nervous system machine in an effort to help stimulate the stem cells in his body, hoping that his body can/will start fighting off the toxins in his system on its own.  Luke has recently learned of a Holistic Clinic in Wichita, KS that tested and successfully treated a gentleman, with the same/similar affliction, in 2002. (That gentleman not only survived, today he is a living testimony of the treatment he received there!) The cost of the initial visit to the clinic is $3,700. This includes Diagnostic Testing, IV Therapy and all blood work. Unfortunately, it does not include costs of any treatment after the first initial visit. Neither does it include food, lodging or travel either way. Luke is currently unable to work at all. He has exhausted all of his financial resources. Even without the financial burden hanging over Luke, the sheer uncertainty of the outcome of his diagnosis, and whether one, both or neither of the limited possible treatment options will work, is a heavy burden to bear. During this time of extreme uncertainty in Luke’s life, we are asking you to, please, find it in your hearts to contribute whatever you can financially to help Luke and his special family. It matters not if the donation is large or small, any amount will be greatly appreciated. If you cannot give financially, PLEASE lift Luke up to Jesus in your prayers, and please pray without ceasing! Luke and his family, and friends know and believe in the healing power of prayer! We serve an awesome God! (We will try to post updates about Luke’s prognosis and progress to this page as they become available.)

668,https://www.gofundme.com/f/solomon-islands-support-mission,"Tools for Vatu Training Center, Solomon  Islands","Please share this effort far and wide! Goals: This fundraising capaign targets financial assistance to purchase hand and power tool kits (x10) needed for trade skills training courses occurring at Vatu Rural Training Centre in Gudalcanal, Solomon Islands. Any funds raised in excess of our goal will be allocated to the Solomon Islands Rural Training Center's non-profit general fund. The overarch impetus for my taking this trip to one of the most remote corners of the planet comes by way of my inherent need to solve problems and assist those eager to help themselves.  People: My name is Chris Guttenberg, I'm currently in the Solomon Islands - where I served as a U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer and Logistics Cordinator from 1996-'99. I reside in Missoula, Montana USA. I work as a building contractor and hostel owner. My educational background lies in renewable energy technology and vocational skills research & training at both the high school and university levels. Returning to the Solomon Islands means not only reconnecting with long time Peace Corps friends and ongoing support organizations, but actually working along side local partners here - the leaders who continually provides me critical industry, language and cross-cultural understanding. Place: Although Melanesia can be perceived as 'exotic' from outside it's Oceanic borderlines, it's the furthest thing from it. People here are regularly subjected to all that comes with a staggering 33% annual rate, changing climate, malaria, dengue, water and sanitation issues, chronic power shortages, rampant corruption, malnutrition, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis and sea level rise. Although peaceful and tranquil, this place has a lot of progress to pursue.   I was introduced (and now reconnected) to a group of dedicated tenacious leaders who are able to visualize and move students towards  positive lasting change. My being here is on purpose; to return an olive branch of care, support, awareness & survival to these leaders and those following in their footsteps.  During 2014 the Solomons we're ravaged by a series of nasty hurricanes and floods which left most subsistence-level villages in peril. Since then, I have been communicating with my long time friend and counterpart James Manangelea about ways we can remediate some lasting issues specifically occurring at the vocation school we started together nearly 20 years ago. James and I have reconnected now, as of March 4th, 2019 (see photo above). Vatu Rural Training Center is located in the central plain's of north-central Guadalcanal Island/Province.  A primary part of my Peace Corps assignment concentrated on launching the school with James and his village community. We initially enrolled 7 student and now Vatu R.T.C. caters to 35 boarding students; boys and girls with varying abilities between the ages of 13 + 20 .  Six support staff and their families also live at the training center. Together the school community cultivates meal program gardens and grows/harvests materials required to build and maintain classroom and workshop spaces in conjunction with curriculum design. (Read about the purpose of Rural Training Centers in the Solomon Islands by clicking the link  below) Essentially R.T.C.'s  are intended to serve as learning communities, self-sustaining educational facilities where improving life through capacity building remain paramount - a pedagogical focal point which guides this country's R.T.C. teaching & learning program.  Unfortunately, budgetary constrains brought on by misappropriated governmental support funding means there is a perpetual funding shortfall at these centers. Student fees avg. $2,000 Solomon dollars, which amounts to 30 US dollars per student per year. Staff here work unpaid, merely asking for food support and a chance to be involved in a positive, active and vibrant learning community. Supporting this process is where I'm asking for your compassion & generosity. Currently the Training Center is experiencing a high incidents of housing and classroom structural degradation, beyond that which the students can keep up with. So, instead of us using our building know-how to repair everything ourselves, James and I have come up with a more appropriate and lasting educational solution, one which requires tools etc. and training for teachers and students at Vatu RTC. I will be living, inspiring and assisting at the Center during the next 3 weeks. Call to action: The course work and construction projects  will require that James and I go shopping together and then 'ship' things back to Vatu from the capital Honiara. Our plan is to compile 10 hand-tool kits, 10 kg. fastening hardware, misc. sized timbers and a handful of essential power tools from a local hardware store.  Each toolkit will be used by one student from a Building Construction class who will be working on 3 different buildings for 2 hrs each day and will remain at the center for regular class time use. The power tools will be used by instructors only, to prepare materials for the students to make building repairs and additions.   Step 1 will be to build a locker room,  through which students can access and return their tools in before and after class each day. Each hand tool kit (x10) will include:  25 foot tape measure, hammers, pencils, carpentry squares, furniture squares, string/chalk line, crosscut & rip saws, chisel sets, sharpening stones, sandpaper and nail sets. Power tools: Portable Honda generator Electric extension cord Power plane Circular saw Extra blade Materials' 40 - 2""x4"" timbers Hand nails Thank you for your generous contribution and supporting this mission on behalf of hard working Solomon Islanders!

After observing our indoor felines and taking some time, they decided we were safe enough and were getting closer in search of food and fresh water.  We began feeding a couple, and more showed up. After a while, we had a crew of felines looking forward to meals and absolutely cherishing clean water. While they are community cats that do not share homes with humans, we noticed that they appeared healthy and well-fed. After talking to our neighbors with adjoining properties and going over cat descriptions, we found that we were similarly caring for many of the same free-roaming cats. We see freedom and joy expressed by these thriving beings as they bask in the sun and play with toy balls we put out for them. We are happy to support them, as there are currently many cats in shelters awaiting adoption and many more being denied their lives due to a lack of resources and space. For the cold days of winter, we have set up outdoor shelters with straw for warmth. We have done our best to fund all of these provisions, but now we want to do more, and that is where you come in! Will you help us get medical care for these sweet cats? It is time to get everyone tested for FIV and FELV (cats with either of these contagious illnesses will need to be placed in loving homes); dewormed; given flea medicine; vaccinated against rabies, distemper and FIV; spayed and neutered. Some will require further medical care if they have any injuries or illnesses. Pregnancy can be rough on those living out and many kittens do not thrive due to all of the health risks and dangers. Cats live peacefully in neighborhoods when they are not competing with so many others for food and space. Let us do the humane trapping, holding, feeding and other caring, setting up and transporting to appointments, administering medicine and releasing or finding homes. Your generosity will help us cover the medical costs.

I am raising money to help alleviate the financial stress that will come along with what recently happened to my little sisters pup. Circumstances are still up in the air, but we do know that costs are already increasing. Any help is so appreciated. . Here are words from my sister about what happened: . ""On Wednesday, January 9th my 4 year old puppy Alaska ran outside like she does every morning. Not even 30 seconds after I left her out, I heard a really loud yelp. I ran outside to see her walking towards the door, but instead of being on all fours, she was dragging her back legs behind her. She was paralyzed. I ran over and picked her up and immediately brought her to the vet. We were then sent to a neurology vet for further evaluation. After she was looked at, I was told that she had either one of two problems, both with uncertain outcomes. The first thing that could be causing her paralysis is a stroke. In most cases this resolves over time but can cause permanent deficits and require medication for the rest of her life. The other thing it could be is a ruptured spinal disc. If this is what is causing her paralysis, she will need spinal surgery to survive.  The vets are also recommending an MRI to try to figure out the root cause of her situation.  Right now she is staying at the vet for the next few days. She is getting medication that will hopefully help her regain her mobility but the outcome is still unknown. Alaska is the best dog I could ever ask for. She is so loving, cuddly and always excited to see anyone. She’s my best friend. So please help in any way you can!

There aren't universities who teach about children with special needs and many parents are never told that with education and training, their children can live happy and productive lives. It can be terrifying and isolating. However, Masha, her husband, and many of their Christian friends love and serve the Down Syndrome community by doing monthly outings, a week-long summer camp, and now, pottery!  Masha works at Kruti-Verti pottery studio full-time but in the last year, she started having children with Downs come and not only play with clay (which is useful for their fine motor skills) but create items for sale (profits go to the families). Anyone who knows Masha knows how big her heart is and knows that this is what she is called to do. In order to better serve the community, Masha and her husband Sasha want to use an unused room in their home as a pottery studio so that Masha can spend her extra hours serving these children and their families. The room needs minor repairs but most of all, they need specialized furniture and a potter's wheel.

They come for three hours every evening, four days out of the week, no matter if they worked hours upon hours or are too tired to function; they are always in class ready to learn! We serve a wide variety of students from varying social, academic and financial backgrounds. All of whom are the most caring, intelligent and overall wonderful people you could ever have the pleasure of meeting. I've said it once and I'll say it for the rest of my life; if I had to teach this class without pay, I wouldn't hesitate for a second. The program the students come to is extensive and thorough, but many of the students lack the supplies to take home and study on their own time. We are allowed to use materials and such, but only limited to the classroom and cannot be written on. Our hope is that with the money that is raised we can buy students Bilingual Dictionaries (Oxford), Citizenship Books (Voice of Freedom) and any other supplies that they may take home and extend their learning to their households, so they can be even more successful!

She is healing now from an acute concussion and the tumor will be removed as soon as possible. The surgery is scheduled for late February and will require many overnight trips to Boston from her home in Amherst. Her mother will be missing work during this time to care for her.

Kinda embarrassing when you think about it. My daddy took me to see the vet and he took a look at my face. Both my lower eyelids have rolled into my eyes. And they have been scratching my corneas. This caused this brown pigment to develope. Its covering part of my corneas which made me lose some eyesight. Unfortunately its permanent. The surgery will correct my lower eyelids and will prevent me from going blind. After they fix my eyes, they need to pull one of my molars. I broke it and it hurts. My daddy has some of the cost for both surgeries, he just needs a little help. Whatever you can help out with will be so much appreciated!   Hey everyone. This is not my style to do one of these GoFundMe things. But Jasmine is my world. I struggle with her getting older. I also know that, like myself, as she gets older, things are gonna start to go...

Comme tout Québécois digne de ce nom, vous vous êtes sûrement déjà servi de cette évidence pour commencer une conversation. Dernièrement, les commis de dépanneurs du Québec doivent entendre plus souvent : « Osti, on gèle! » que « Bonjour! » de la part des clients qui passent la porte. Parce que oui, on va se le dire, ost** qu’y fait frette. Comme chaque hiver; mais cette année est particulièrement cruelle pour les oreilles, les joues ou tout autre petit bout de chair se retrouvant au grand air… Si vous êtes en train de lire ceci, vous avez probablement accès à un minimum de confort et de commodités. Au pire, peut-être devez-vous changer de main de temps en temps, si vous êtes dehors, pour pitonner sur votre cellulaire. Pis si ça vous gosse que vos lunettes embuent quand vous rentrez à l’intérieur, dites-vous que certains n’en ont aucun « intérieur ». Le nombre d’itinérants au Québec est, malheureusement, en hausse constante. Les maisons d’hébergement manquent de lits et doivent régulièrement retourner des gens dans la rue. En hiver. Présentement. Dans le froid. Pour une troisième année consécutive, j’organise une collecte de fonds pour aider les sans-abris de la ville : levée de fonds qui me sert à acheter des p’tits trucs que je vais ensuite leur distribuer directement dans la rue. Tout a commencé il y a deux ans...  Je me suis réveillée un matin d’hiver en capotant dans mon lit… Ma marge de crédit plutôt pleine, mon prêt étudiant à rembourser, ma job incertaine… Pis, tout d’un coup, j’ai réalisé que pendant que je stressais à propos de ma vie j’étais, moi, dans mon lit douillet. J’avais peut-être des dettes, mais j’avais un toit, un lit chaud pis de la bouffe dans le frigo. Quand même plus que plusieurs personnes... Je me suis sentie poche. Vraiment. Pis j’ai décidé que c’était trop facile de juste m’en rendre compte sans rien faire. J’ai organisé une collecte « Gofundme » qui m’a permis d’amasser 400 $ pour acheter des trucs pratiques pour ceux qui « vivent nulle part » en plein hiver : des cartes-cadeaux de l’épicerie, des bas de laine, des tuques, des foulards, des  « chauffe-mains », des kits de brosses à dents/dentifrices, des tampons, des couvertures, etc. Je m’étais renseignée avant pour acheter des choses pertinentes, mais surtout pour savoir comment interagir avec les gens… Comment les aborder sans les faire fuir, sans qu’ils se sentent mal à l’aise… Pas évident. Un humain reste fier,  même dans ses pires moments. Ben, je pense que la journée de la distribution, mes compagnes et moi avons été encore plus touchées que ceux qui ont bénéficié de nos achats… Les réponses les plus populaires : – Non non… j’en ai pas besoin. – Ben là, je veux pas trop en prendre… je veux en laisser pour les autres. – Je peux pas… je pourrai jamais vous le remettre. – Ben, ok… Mais avec ma carte-cadeau de l’épicerie, je vais faire une grosse « batch » de sauce à spaghetti, pis je vais inviter tous mes amis de l’Auberivière. Pis je vais même mettre des champignons! On en revenait pas à quel point ces personnes avaient de la compassion pour les autres! Je l’ai refait l’année passée, et j’ai amassé environ 600 $! Une autre incroyable expérience!  Je recommence donc cette année. En plus, j’aurai une petite « cellule » pour suivre mes pas au Nouveau-Brunswick! Wow! Une amie va le faire de son côté avec son fils de 7 ans. Il a de la difficulté à comprendre que ces gens n’ont simplement pas de maison...   Imaginez-vous en plein hiver québécois avec… RIEN. Pour vous, une paire de bas de laine, c’est peut-être pas grand-chose. Pour eux, c’est pas seulement de la chaleur aux pieds, c’est de la chaleur au cœur.

711,https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-big-apple-solution-for-joshua,The Big Apple Solution for Joshua,"My close personal friend Jessica Ruettimann is one of the most caring and devoted mothers I know. When you first meet Jess you will usually hear about her husband Nick and their three amazing sons, Joshua, Jaxon, and Jameson within the first couple minutes (they're probably her favorite topic). However, once you get to know Jess more you will begin to hear about a lot of doctors appointments that she has scheduled every couple of weeks which result in many missed days of work. These appointments are not for Jess but for her son Joshua. Joshua was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation in 2016 just months after he started kindergarten when many symptoms started to show. What is Chiari Malformation you ask? Well, to give you a brief insight it is structural defect in the base of the skull and cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance. Normally the cerebellum and parts of the brain stem sit above an opening in the skull that allows the spinal cord to pass through it (called the foramen magnum) in technical terms. To make it simple, his brain is pushing out the bottom back part of his skull. Fast forward in July of 2017 he had bone only decompression surgery. He was only 6 years old. They removed a piece of his skull to make more room for his brain. Immediately after waking up from surgery he said “my mouth feels better”, which was amazing because they never knew his mouth hurt. They were optimistic and besides some balance problems that are normal after brain surgery, he went a few months without any symptoms.  Slowly but surely symptoms started to come back and they tried to remain optimistic. His Neurosurgeon ordered a follow up MRI of his brain and spine. The results from the MRI showed that his brain looked great, so great that the Surgeon planned on using Joshua’s decompression images in seminars. The only problem is that he is still having symptoms.  They have been to the Fraser Center (to check for behavioral/learning disorders), a Neurologist, a Plastic Surgeon, an Orthodontist, ENT’s, the Geneticist, Gastroenterology, Speech Therapy, Pediatric Neurosurgeon, etc. and it all ends the same way – getting referred to a different specialist. He has had MRI’s, Swallow Studies, Ultrasounds, Esophagrams, etc..  Joshua struggles every single day. Some of his symptoms include: · Vomiting (almost daily – sometimes multiple times a day) · Short-Term Memory Problems · Constant Dry Cough · Restricted Mobility of his Tongue · Inability to open his mouth wide, puff his cheeks, spit, etc.  · Delayed Fine Motor Skills Just recently they came across an opportunity to see a Chiari Specialist. Not only is this Dr. a Chiari Specialist, but he is knowledgeable about all disorders associated with Chiari. He could give them ALL of the answers that they have desperately been looking for and to finally have a possible sense of normalcy in their lives. Dr. Greenfield is in New York, New York. Only problem – they are in Elk River, Minnesota.  This family is desperate to get answers but with the medical bills from Joshua's illness money is tight. Getting to New York is not cheap but they are willing to take the chance to hopefully find some answers for Joshua.  Help me help them to have a chance to give Joshua a shot at getting some real answers. All proceeds raised will be used to get Joshua and Jess to New York. All remaining proceeds will be used to help alleviate Joshua's medical bills.",1549526400,5000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/T3_YiiGrHB5P-K2hKeVoFY74_DI=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913262_1549594631115919_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913262_1549598594114763_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913262_1549598608750792_r.jpeg",3600,a young boy holding a baseball bat in his hands .,nan,a group of stuffed animals sitting on top of a bed . a woman holding a toothbrush in her hand .

She sustained extensive injuries to her brain, spine, arms, and lungs and is at Dell Seton Medical Center in Austin where their  team is working relentlessly.  In the world of Athletic Training, compassionate healthcare extends beyond each sport, it looks deeper than just an injury, this is a continuous process to remind each individual that the best is yet to come, no matter the circumstance. As Athletic Trainers, we naturally become “the person we wish we had when we were down” at one point or another. We believe in compassionate healthcare for ALL, including ourselves. One of our own is going through the fight of her life, it will be a process, but one that we will see her through. Kendall, you said you got into Athletic Training because of the opportunity it gives you to help people and see them through process, that the relationships it allowed you to build, to “be someone” for them is truly rewarding for you. Well Kendall Brookins, we are here for you!!!  Financial goals are climbing, so we want to do what we can. $50,000 seems like a crazy number, to be honest I wasn’t even sure what amount to put I just felt aim high and trust. Whatever number we reach is a blessing, this will be a process.  These next few days are critical. With that, April 11th is also Kendall’s 25th birthday. Between now and Thursday can we see how much love we can spread to do what we can specifically for the financial aspect for the Brookins family. Talk, write, reach out, share whatever you can, please take a moment to get the word out. Truly everything helps, whole heartedly we ask for prayers to accompany this.

724,https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-convent-station,Save Convent Station,"The purpose of this fundraising effort is to raise money for   to oppose the 119 unit apartment complex proposed for the parking lot of the Madison Hotel at the intersection of Madison Avenue, Convent Road and Old Turnpike Road.  The Morris Township Zoning Board of Adjustment is presently considering approval of this high density apartment complex. The next hearing is scheduled for January 28, 2019 at 7:30PM.   This project will transform the neighborhood we know and love from a quiet low-density residential haven to an urban thoroughfare crawling with cars. As we all know, traffic on Madison Avenue has been increasing steadily over the years and is gridlocked during rush hour.  We already have an excess amount of multi-family, townhome and condominium development in this lovely area of Morris Township including the new Honeywell/K.Hovnanian project, proposed Provident Bank apartments and new townhomes being built behind Liberty Greens.     This development will include 119 apartments, ranging from studio to 3 bedroom units (4 levels are planned with a height greater than the existing hotel).  These new residents will add at least 240 new cars and many hundreds of new trips daily out of the site.  Because of this increased traffic, drivers will look for less congested traffic routes resulting in increased traffic on side streets such as Crescent Drive, Old Turnpike Road, Shephard Place, Barberry Rd, Canfield Rd, Old Glen Rd, Kitchell, Treadwell and Danforth Road. These streets will become cut-through streets that will transform our quiet residential streets to much busier urban-like thoroughfares.   Parking is already at a premium at Convent Station and the development proposed by the Madison Hotel will include a fraction of the parking needed for the units, causing a further parking crisis and meaning cars will end up parking illegally on all of our streets.   The effects of this massive increase in traffic will have many other far-reaching effects as well. Safety will become an issue for children playing in their front yards and neighborhood street areas. Residents of the surrounding community will experience longer commute and trip times, and there will undoubtedly be increased accidents and injuries.   Since The Madison Hotel project is a high density apartment complex, it is not compatible with the surrounding area of residential homes and is not in compliance with the Morris Township Master Plan, as it changes the zoning from office/laboratory to high density apartment zoning, with the impact being that this zoning change will lower the home values in the surrounding neighborhoods and continue to do so if the precedent continues. As we are all aware, home values are affected by the increased traffic, decreased air quality, increased noise, dust and pollutants that come with higher density housing. The Madison Hotel project is well funded by the owners of the Madison Hotel.  Citizens to Save Convent Station was formed by immediate neighbors to raise awareness and our cause is now gaining momentum.  However, it is very expensive to properly oppose a well-funded project by a developer with deep pockets.  In addition, the detrimental aspects of the project must be conveyed to the surrounding neighborhoods via a comprehensive awareness campaign involving a number of communication tools such as signs, flyers, mailings, postage, web sites and social media, all of which carry costs. Citizens to Save Convent Station will work tirelessly to see that this project is defeated and our initial group of neighbors have already committed $5K towards the fight.  However, we cannot financially compete against the deep-pockets of the Madison Hotel without matching funding.

However, it breaks my heart that I cannot provide the kind of magical wedding day that my incredible fiancée deserves. She is a full-time ER nurse that works hard taking care of others, in addition to traveling around the world as a rescue nurse escorting sick patients back to their homes.  It's frustrating that the wedding business is priced so steep that two stable adults cannot afford more than city hall and a cold banquet room to celebrate their love for one another. I know what you're thinking, it doesn't matter where we get married, it shouldn't matter, we could just go to the JP, especially since this is my ""second go-round"". BUT, this amazing human whom I adore has waited her whole life & has dedicated herself to others, so  .  When parents struggle to accept the things they don't understand, & therefore withdraw or limit their support, it leaves us with no choice but to swallow our pride & ask for help. No amount of money will make up for the fact that my own father is choosing not to be there to walk me down the aisle, or the hurt we feel when we're treated differently than straight couples, but being able to celebrate our love like a ""normal"" couple, is a step in the right direction.

731,https://www.gofundme.com/f/gssd7k-casper-medical-fund,Casper Medical Fund,"Casper's life was tragically cut short due to an unidentified, rare and progressive lung disease. In his 1 year of life, he proved to be the most loyal companion I have ever known.  We adopted Casper from a local animal shelter in October 2017, and I began to notice his abnormal cough in early 2018. I took him to several vets for different opinions, but none took me seriously and one even said ""Some cats just have a cough."" Despite his cough, he seemed normal until October 2018, when he suffered a grand mal seizure for no apparent reason. This warranted our first trip to an emergency vet, who also did nothing. Two weeks later, before Thanksgiving 2018, we woke up and Casper was not there. After searching the house, we found him in the basement with blue lips, nose, and eyes, struggling to breathe. He could not physically get up the stairs but tried staggering towards us for help. I rushed him to a different emergency vet where he was treated with tons of different medications and oxygen.  At this point, I was prepared to put Casper to sleep and end his suffering. As a graduate student with limited income, I spoke with the vets about the extent to which we should continue with the testing, due to financial concerns. They really convinced me that the tests should show SOMETHING to identify a cause, but none did. He was tested for heart failure, FIV, etc. and even underwent a tracheal wash surgery to examine the lung fluid at the microscopic level. Still no identifiable disease. You may be wondering why I didn't just put him down. Honestly...the vets thought it was pneumonia with asthma and said he would recover and live a long life, especially since the medications started working. They sent him home after 1 day. He was clearly not ok, and I tried to keep him in their care, but they said he was fine and to just administer the 5 different meds twice daily for 3 weeks. It was a struggle because Casper vomited every time he took meds. He seemed to finally be recovering and even had a clear, normal chest x-ray after finishing medications.  Casper was still coughing, had labored breathing, and constantly lethargic, but still made sure he comforted me during my toughest semester in grad school. He was one hell of a friend. We were thick as thieves. He was my first real pet and I did everything I could to take care of him, even spoiled him a little. He passed on New Year's Eve in the kennel while we were away for the holidays. I didn't want to board him, but I thought that he would be well monitored given the boarding facility was at his vet's office. It was a holiday, so the staff only checked him during the day when he seemed fine, then finding him unresponsive and deceased in the morning. He suffocated to death, alone, and confined. A truly terrible way to die. It breaks my heart that I wasn't there for him when he needed me the most, but he was certainly loved and he knew it.  This year I am graduating with my Master's from Georgia Tech, without Casper by my side through my last semester. Had I been told the right moment to put him to sleep, I surely would have, as his comfort was the most important thing to me. No one really knew what he had or that it was terminal, but we did our best.  Casper is buried in the backyard under the pine trees and the bird boxes, with a small bird bath because he loved being outside, playing with water, and knocking over all my cups. Once the weather gets warmer I will plant an Ivory flower shrub that blooms with white flowers in October, for my white October kitty. Rest easy and in Peace, my boy.",1547107200,3000,0,0,https://images.gofundme.com/TwYBlav5E9FKikd_rgWjnyCFIXs=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131475358522_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131501899870_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131522734654_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_154713154347804_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_154713155965816_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131567977363_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131575384420_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131582768795_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131599984602_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131615209725_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131644693527_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131680865383_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131708311941_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131725553742_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131768482879_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131833826781_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36084032_1547131911650254_r.jpeg",135,a white and white cat laying on top of a wooden table .,nan,a cat is curled up in a bathroom sink . a cat laying on top of a wooden bench . a cat laying on top of a white chair . a man with a cat and a cat on his shoulder . a small child is holding a stuffed animal a cat is laying on a white blanket . a cat laying on top of a black suitcase . a cat sitting on top of a blue chair . a cat laying on top of a pair of shoes . a cat sitting on a couch with a remote . a cat laying on top of a bed . a cat laying on top of a white blanket . a cat laying on top of a blanket on a bed . a cat sitting on top of a wooden chair . a cat is sitting on top of a box . a cat laying on top of a blanket on a bed .
732,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-carolyn-fight-leukemia,Help Carolyn fight leukemia,"Hello! My wife, Carolyn was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia ( T- Cell Prolymphocytic leukemia, or tpll) in January 2019. As you can all imagine, this came as a devastating news to us.  She had been dealing with swelling and inflammation on her legs for many years and in January of 2018, her condition rapidly deteriorated. We went from specialist to specialist searching for answers- she went from just swelling on her legs to developing skin ulcers and she was in a tremendous amount of pain. During this time, we saw specialists from vascular, rheumatology , hematology and no one could give us a definite answer as to what was happening to her legs.  In the summer of 2018, with treatment from Wake Forest Hospital’s Wound Care, her legs got better and things seemed normal again. But in the fall, the wounds came back with a vengeance and it got to a point where she was in so much pain that she had to quit her job indefinitely as we kept looking for answers. Then on January 4, 2019, a visit to Duke University Hospital rheumatology appt turned into a hospital stay as one of the head doctors saw her legs and wanted to run some tests. After a few days, the tests came back with the news none of us expected- that she had leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy was done to confirm this rare form of leukemia.  She has been undergoing Campath treatment 3x a week, an antibody drug treatment which is used to specifically treat this type of leukemia. The treatment lasts about 12 weeks, sometimes longer depending on the progress the patient makes. Once the cancer is in remission, she will have to get a stem cell transplant.  But my wife is a real fighter and she has been a champ throughout this ordeal. As the treatments continue and with the impending stem cell transplant, the medicals bills are increasing and as you may know, cancer treatments can be very expensive.  Before the cancer, Carolyn was a full time Spanish teacher at Southwest Guilford High school here in Greensboro, North Carolina. She loves teaching and she misses it and her kids and not being able to work has been very hard for her.  We are parents of 2 beautiful daughters aged 7 and 4 and as a mom, the hardest thing for my wife has been that the cancer has prevented her from being a mom to a full capacity as before. We have a wonderful support system here with family from both of our sides but we know that financially, this could take a toll on us. So we are asking for any little amount that can help alleviate some of these medical expenses.  Please keep Carolyn and our family in your prayers. I believe she can and will kick this cancer’s butt!

They finally happened and I became a college professor back in 2010. In 2017, I left that position for a number of reasons and moved in with my brother and nephew. I was living off from my retirement for a while, but that ran out a year ago. My brother was using my car to travel to his assistant manager job at Dunkin' Donuts (20 miles away) since he lost his car and has to be at work before public transportation begins running. I've been working at Dollar Tree (I have a PhD in chemistry and this is literally the only job out of dozens I applied for that would hire me) for two months trying to earn the money to keep my car so my brother could keep working. But, like all of us who are living paycheck to paycheck, emergencies and unexpected expenses came up and the money I was making for my car had to go to our rent.  Now our January rent is past due and my car was repossessed for nonpayment earlier this week. My brother has missed several days of work and is on the verge of losing his job. His next (and possibly final if we don't find a solution fast) paycheck has to go to pay rent, but he also needs that money to get a rental car and/or save towards the purchase of a used car. It's the proverbial rock and a hard place.  He is desperate for a car that will last us until he can get back on his feet. If he can't get a car fast, he (and me and his 11-year-old son) will be homeless in a few weeks when it comes time to pay February rent and the money isn't there. We are both extremely hardworking and have worked hard to make a better life for ourselves, but it seems like we just keep getting punched in the gut. No full-time working American should ever have to worry about paying for the basics and risk homelessness, but yet here we are.  This money will be used to purchase a used car for my brother so that he can keep his job, including registration and the first month of insurance. $3500 should be enough to get a halfway decent car, but need at least $1500 to get into anything. Can you please help reach this goal? I hate to ask; we were raised to be independent and not to ask help from others, but we are desperate. I don't know what else to do; I've tried everything else I could think of. Please help if you can.

746,https://www.gofundme.com/f/6p39ddc,Quinn Needs Our Help,"Below is a play by play of the events of the week from Kim. Any amount is appreciated to help the Beebe family get through this nightmare. While things have gone incredibly well so far, Quinn still has a long road to recovery. There will be doctor's appts and therapy. Thank you so much to everyone who has reach out to help. Kim, Ryan and Quinn are overwhelmed and thankful for each and everyone one of you. *UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM* This is quite difficult to post publicly but we feel that it’s necessary at this time as we are unable to keep up with text messages, emails and phone calls. The last week or so, Quinn had been complaining of headaches specifically in the forehead area. She has never experienced headaches before so we did what we’d normally do with complaints of pain or sickness and gave her ibuprofen/Tylenol for a few days. It did not seem to relieve the pain at all and about 4-5 days ago we noticed that she started walking clumsily and was holding up her right arm like she was a little teapot while walking and could not walk in a straight line. I made an appointment with her pediatrician on Wednesday January 9th at 5:00pm, we brought her in for the sick visit and the doctor was very concerned. She sent us directly up to Hasbro ER and made some phone calls to get us in right away. The ER physician ordered a CT scan of her head after a full exam and second opinion from the attending doctor. We had no idea what they were going to tell us when they brought in a special life coach to keep Quinn company while they spoke with us in another room within the ER. Quinn was diagnosed with a very large brain tumor in the “Posterior Fossa” of her skull, which is in the bottom back side of her brain and that she would be admitted into the ICU immediately. Our hearts sank as we absorbed this information we were scared, shocked, sad and angry. These are just a few of the feelings we felt right away as our little girl had been just about perfect since birth. Thursday January 10th we met with the Pediatric Neuro-Surgical Team at Hasbro to discuss what our options were. After they read the MRI, they recommended full removal of the orange sized tumor after placement of a tube on the top of her head was done so the build up of spinal fluid would slowly drain out to relieve some of the pressure on her brain which was causing the headaches. The benefits outweighed the risks and we decided to go ahead with the procedure. Friday January 11th, the Neuro team wheeled Quinn out of the room and into the OR around 8:00am and did not return back to the room until 5:30pm. The Surgeon came in and told us she felt very confident that the entire tumor was removed and that she sent a sample of it to Pathology to be tested for cancer. We are still awaiting the results on that and are currently awaiting a follow up MRI to confirm the entire tumor was removed. Saturday January 12th, Quinn is in a lot of pain but is being so brave! We have a long road ahead of us with healing and therapy but we have lots of love from our amazing team at Hasbro, but most importantly our village of family and friends have been an amazing support throughout this terrifying, whirlwind journey the last few days. We will get back to everyone as soon as we can with updates on Quinn but for now, please say a prayer or send positive thoughts our way as we could never have enough. Thanks again for the love and support, we are so very lucky and thankful for all of you! Sincerely, Ryan, Kim & Quinn ❤️ ***Quinn’s Neuro Surgeon just called - THE TUMOR HAS BEEN REMOVED 100%!!

Despues de tres semanas de estudios y hospitalización, le diagnosticaron un tumor en la vejiga.  No se ha confirmado el tipo de tumor, por eso es necesario un estudio nuclear para poder confirmar y entonces poder prepararlo para operación. Para hacer el estudio nuclear, hay que mandar a buscar un tinte a EEUU, el cual tiene un costo de $3,300 y el plan médico no lo cubre. Esto es solo el tinte, sin contar el estudio ni la operación con los gastos de hospitalización posteriores.  No soy persona de pedir ayuda, de hecho, siempre he vivido ayudando a los demás.

He is beating the odds everyday which shows his strength and willingness to still be on this earth. My name is Yesenia and I lost my father, 75 year old Vietnam Veteran to Colon Cancer on 1/23/2019, one month after his diagnosis. It’s been devastating to say the least. I have found comfort in spending time with his friends at his assisted living facility. They are such an amazing group of people and being around them helps me feel closer to my father. One of these amazing human beings is his Herb. While being at the facility and learning about his group of friends I learned some devastating news about Herb.  Herb, is 96 year old WW2 veteran who has been in hospice care now for over 6 months. He is very ill but still very much with it. He misses my father so much and every time he sees me walk in he lights up and tells me how seeing me makes him feel like my father is near. He is a precious soul and unfortunately does not have any family to help fight for him. His best friend’s wife has taken on assisting him and making sure he is taken care of financially at his facility/home. Unfortunately due to his condition he needs 24/7 care which has to come from a private company and he has been using his savings account to pay for this but his savings is now officially depleted. He received aid and attendance from the VA and his social security which help keep him at the amazing facility he is at. He has been paying for his private care needed on his own for the past 2 months at $16 an hour 24 hrs. a day 7 days a week. He did not expect to live this long, but he is, and now that his money is running out this Friday 2/15/19. Herb is devastated at the reality of having to leave not only his home, but his friends, which are truly his family and all he has. The VA has offered him a bed at one of their 24/7 care facilities but clearly this is not what he wants. He does not want to leave the only home he knows and to be honest he shouldn’t have to. This man fought for our country in WW2 and now it is our turn to fight for him. Not only will he lose his family at his facility and all the amazing staff that know and love him but he will lose his Hospice care team which has grown to know and love him. He would have to have a whole new team as the new facility is out of his current team’s jurisdiction. He served proudly with PBSO volunteering and helping with meals on wheels as well as volunteering at JFK medical Center. This man loved to serve and now it’s our turn to serve him! Can you please help me fight for Herbie’s dying request to die at home with the ones he loves. I vow to keep this man at his home surrounded by the love he deserves. I know it’s hard to donate when someone is at their end of life but I beg you to find it inside your heart to think of your loved one and or even yourself when you are older how it would feel to truly have nobody fighting for you and being left to die alone. Nobody deserves this. Although Herbie is a fighter, clearly his time on this earth is near. So with that said my goal is to guarantee him at least 3 months which would be $35,712.00 but even if we can start at a month by month goal  which would be $11,520. If 100 people share this within their communities and each community raises $1,000.00 that will give Herbie at least one more month for now.  Ideally finding someone to sponsor his care would relieve so much stress and the guarantee that he can just live the rest of his life peacefully at home but since that has not been possible to find yet, we fight together for Herbie as a community donating to this mans very well deserved cause.  I know it’s hard to donate to someone’s end of life, so, because of this I vow that if you are able to make a donation and Herbie passes before its use, I will return those funds to you at your request. You do not have to publicly make that request on GOFUNDME and can privately message me at Yesenia2388@gmail.com and state your name and donation amount you would like/need refunded should it not get used. But for now we need to guarantee his stay. Any donation large or small will be forever appreciated.  Please help me share this GOFUND me and lets together keep Herbie home. Also to clarify Herbies beneficiary, Kathleen Schaum. Kathleen and her husband have been best friends with Herbie for over 2O years. After Herbie's health began to decline Kathleen was appointed his Power of Attorney and is his Guardian and friend who on top of helping him with his finances, is a part of his everyday and journey with Atria, Hospice care to include but not limit to being with Herbie at his numerous Dr appointments and providing for his everyday needs.",1549526400,35712,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/x_FZjbs8G5GQwM-NBhJS1ejM8Mg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913196_1549631186261911_r.jpeg,,13513,a man sitting at a table with a plate of food .,nan,

You turn the corner to cut over to grab a coffee or some breakfast, check your mail box, meet your friends at the bar. There on the wall is something different, and it makes you smile. There is a photograph six feet high from a bygone era of Marfa’s history. You think you don’t know the laughing children in the photograph, but maybe that one looks like your grandma, or maybe your neighbor. You’ve got a minute, so you pull up the audio link on your phone. A marching band plays a song, and a woman tells a story related to the photograph. Her voice is rich with the spirit of the borderlands. Whether you’ve met her before or not, you know this woman. She is our history, our heritage, the keeper of another time before the Marfa of today. You continue on your way, and around another corner, you find another image plastered to a blank wall. A teenage boy and girl lean against a car and smile. Their clothes, the car, the black and white photo take you back to a time before time. This audio features the voice of a man—each story a piece of the puzzle of a community’s history. If you are new to Marfa, perhaps you had no idea of all the wonders and hardships of Marfa before the art. You want to learn more. If you were born here, you see your family and its history reflected in the town’s history. You want to learn more, too. You realize that more of these giant pictures dot the town. You pick up a guide to the walking tour at the coffee shop and spend the rest of the afternoon exploring, learning, laughing, mourning, and understanding a little bit more about who we are. The   , in partnership with   , presents a walking tour of Marfa’s history from the perspective of former students, teachers, friends, and neighbors of the Blackwell School.  The project will gather oral histories, sounds, and images to create a walking tour of twenty sites around the community, debuting at the    on Saturday, April 27. The images will be on display for one year. In addition, a newspaper will be created that contains a map guiding locals and visitors alike on the walking tour and a selection of photographs and stories associated with the tour. The newspaper will be distributed across the community in stores, hotels, community centers, schools, and government offices.  During the Block Party, Borderland Collective will set up an interactive activity allowing the community to contribute further to the historical narratives. This thematic and interactive art program and experience brings together diverse communities and varied visions to create a tangible and educational public art work in Marfa to foster pride, ownership, and engagement. The Blackwell Block Party is an annual one-day festival celebrating and commemorating the diverse culture and the rich heritage of Marfa. The 2019 Block Party brings great entertainment, delicious food, music, games, and fun for all ages. The Community Art Spark is a work of public art created for and by the Blackwell School community and our friends, neighbors, and visitors.

756,https://www.gofundme.com/f/s6vpf-discipleship-program,Cert 4 In Theology and Ministry,"Two years ago I was living a life so conflicting to what I knew to be right. I found myself in mental and emotional torment.  The best way I can describe it, is that I had allowed the devil a place in my life through numerous events, which led to me making destructive choices (which I made against my better judgement). My morals and standards began disintegrating to the point that I didn’t recognise who I was anymore.  The impact of these poor decisions had such a hold over me that I was living fearfully and always anxious. Some days I was too anxious to even answer a phone call or reply to txt msg’s.  God is good and didn’t give up on me. Daily He strengthened me with a ‘daily devotion book’ that I had been given. It was so helpful and gave me peace but I knew I needed something more intensive to break free and change the lifestyle I was living. God placed someone in my life to tell me about Teen Challenge (Christian rehab), it was the break I needed to get away from life as I knew it. Through the grace of my Lord and the help of Teen Challenge, I have changed my life around, He brought me out of the dark and into the Light.  I’m  excited to say that as of March 2nd I will be a 2019 Teen Challenge, Grace Academy graduate! I am so happy with the results of the program as I know who I am and who I was created to be.  I feel God did not pluck me out of my circumstances and radically change my heart and my life for it to end here! He wants me to give back.

759,https://www.gofundme.com/f/ZarykahCollegeFund,Zarykah’s Howard College Fund!!,"My name is Zarykah and I’m very excited to announce that I got admitted to Spelman college, one of my TOP CHOICE school! I’m currently a senior at   in New York and I have spent 4 years developing my skills in acting and singing amidst my academic pursuits.  I’m so excited for the opportunity to join and create my own Howard legacy, but I also have my eye on our nation's ongoing crises around student debt. My effort to avoid being another statistic in that crises starts here.  I am raising money to help fund my first year of college.  2019 - 2020 Tuition = $20,399 Room and Board = $6,947 Meals = $5370 The first year will be a transition for me. I want to do everything in my power to focus on academic success during that time. After I get accumulated, I intend to secure a job, furiously apply for scholarships and grants, seek affordable housing and pursue other options throughout my 4 years with hopes to graduate as close to debt-free as possible.  I appreciate whatever you can offer to help me reach that goal! Below is the personal statement I submitted as part of my college application.  It gives you a bit more information about me and my story and the journey i took to get here. Thank you for your time and for reading my story! ______________________________________ Problems. Everybody has them. Naturally, it’s easier to dwell on problems rather than face them. That’s surprisingly not me. I’m the rare percentage of people that love facing problems head on. More problems mean more solutions you can find to each.  Growing up, with a single mother of four children, money was always a problem. We all lived off her teacher’s salary. As a child, you’re often shown an image of everything “working out”--told stories that always have happy endings. I realized early, that there weren’t always happy endings. This reality made me a realist. Seeing her commitment to us taught me empathy, perseverance and problem solving skills. She motivated me to take a risk and audition for the prestigious Fiorello H. LaGuardia Highschool of Performing Arts to pursue my love for acting and singing. Thanks to her never ending love and encouragement, I got in and get to learn more about my passion everyday. In the spirit of taking risks, it was sophomore year when I realized that I had a passion for something other than the arts. Traveling. The pure sensation of getting on a bus, train or plane, in hopes of arriving in a distinct destination excited me to say the least. Unlike most people, it didn’t take a trip to Cancun or a cruise to Spain to realize that. It actually started with an ad on the internet.  “VISIT THE LUXURIOUS DUBAI” Any other day, I’d quickly “X” out of the bothersome pop up without even thinking but this time something was different. This time I looked at the ad and stared long and hard.  “Dubai? Now thats a dream.” I never thought that one day this dream would actually come true. I knew my mother would never be able to pay for a trip that extravagant but that didn’t stop me. Somehow I knew that visiting Dubai wouldn’t be just that--a dream. From then on I started formulating a plan to turn my dream into a reality. I looked up flights, hotels and popular tourist spots I would visit. Then I created a budget and a goal for the money I would need to earn. I knew a good way of accumulating money was selling items. I thought long and hard about what I could sell that people would actually want to buy and it didn’t take me a long time to come up with an answer for my question. Food. This was a perfect solution to my problem. All I had to do was bake enough goods to come up with the money for a plane ticket‍. From there everything else would fall together.  The task itself was quite simple but also VERY challenging. I found myself losing sleep just to reach my goal of 60 brownies per night. I never lost sight of my goal.  I knew that in the end it’d all be worth it.  After 7 months, I had finally reached my goal of 3000 brownies. My brownie business taught me more than I ever thought it could. I now know that I could for certain accomplish anything. The sky's the absolute limit. I learned to never doubt myself and that with time, and perseverance, anything could be achieved.",1554361200,10000,9,0,https://images.gofundme.com/OShkdqkLEGup7Lk5cKYgvDhl9LI=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36913104_1563217992879197_r.jpg,,1730,a man sitting on a skateboard on a sidewalk .,nan,

Sheeba's radius has been dislocated from her elbow with damaged ligaments and possible fractures. In order for her to race around with her brother Hank, she needs to see a surgeon in Victoria which has estimated a cost of $3,500 to $4,500 before follow ups/medication or her second option is to see a surgeon in Langley who thinks the elbow may be able to use a casting technique, a much less invasive operation, which will cost $800 - $1000 before travel and follow ups/medication.  We want to try and get either surgery done by February 17, 2019 so she is no longer in any pain.

However, they have had some unfortunate events fall their way which we wanted to inform you of.   Jennifer’s heart rate had been arrhythmic for a few days and over the weekend she was taken by ambulance and admitted to Emory when her heart rate got so high she thought she was having a heart attack.  At the height of her episodes (which were reoccurring) her heart rate got as high as 240 bpm.  The doctors were able to stabilize her heart rate and bring it back down to normal which is encouraging; however, this is not without additional complications.  Jennifer is currently still in ICU and is now no longer able to fly on a commercial flight down to Mexico.  Mario has been communicating with the doctors who agree the only way she can make it to Mexico is to fly via medical aircraft (aka airplane ambulance).  The risk is far too great if she were to have another arrhythmic episode and not have medical attention immediately available. Additionally, in her fragile state, to fly amongst the general population and risk exposure to countless germs is also no longer a safe option.  The cost to cover their round trip flights to Mexico via medical transport, have necessary ground transportation to/from the hospital, and accommodate her ICU needs at the hospital in Mexico is closing in on $90,000.  As a result, we are increasing her overall raise to $164,000 in order to cover her treatment and additional medical transportation needs.  We know we have already asked a lot of everyone and your generosity thus far has been extraordinary, but if you are able to help contribute once again to her cause we all would be forever grateful.  The words life or death have never been so real before.   Thank in you advance for your love, support, and prayers.  Please keep them coming.  If you'd like to read  more about Jen's cancer journey please check out her blog    How do I even begin to describe the incredible sunshine that Jen is in our lives? Words like loving, encouraging, fierce, spunky, selfless, warm, gracious, loyal, vibrant,  full of life and love... don't even begin to encompass the wonder that she is. Wife to Mario, incredible mother to Eden and Monica, daughter, sister, aunt, niece...and a one of a kind friend to so many. To know Jen is to love her...and love her some more. She has been a cheerleader in so many of our lives...and I would imagine like me, you are probably deeply wishing you could do   to help in her time of need. Jen is so strong, positive, and independent and she has been pushing through this journey for a long time with an incredible attitude. As many of you know, even in the midst of her own fight with cancer, she started ""Join The Flock against Cancer"", a charitable endeavor to ensure others battling cancer have the financial support they need to focus on the fight and, ultimately,  recovery.  Our girl puts the well being of others in front of her own, but while she is unbelievably strong, she cannot fight this battle alone.  Sometimes the smallest gesture can mean the world and while we can’t deliver a “magic eraser”, maybe we can provide some strength and security when it’s needed most.  If you or a loved one have experienced cancer personally,  you know the costs are extraordinary - and even more so when self employed. Currently their monthly insurance premiums alone are extremely high and that is before any treatment, procedure, test, nutritional or supplemental support. Not to mention all of this in addition to the regular expenses of a family of four.  In addition, unfortunately recent tests have shown the cancer is progressing and as a result, expenses will continue to mount as current treatment options carry price tags between $50,000 and $75,000 + travel and she may have to do it twice. The treatment they are considering is a form of immunotherapy with an award winning cancer researcher that has been getting great results on a treatment not yet approved here in the states. It has to be paid for upfront and everything is out of pocket.  I'm hoping that together, we can help lift this financial burden so Jen and Mario can focus on fighting and winning the battle against cancer.  And I pray that through our help, they will feel the immense love of so many surrounding them.  Anything you can give would be amazing. Please feel free to privately pass this on to anyone you feel would want to be a part of this fight. Let's cheer on Team Lazo and lift them up with all we have! Love you guys and I know Jen does too.

Their daughter Tinlee was diagnosed with childhood Leukemia, specifically B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. She is being treated by a wonderful team at Ronald McDonald Children’s Hospital at Loyola in Maywood, IL. The doctors told us that this type of leukemia is the most common and most treatable. Her treatment will be at least 2.5 years consisting of outpatient, inpatient, and home treatment.  Tinlee has always been a happy go lucky girl with a little bit of sass on the side to go with it. The type of kid that can brighten your day by just being in her presence and watching her play. The kid that makes you instantly melt when she calls your name and smiles in excitement when she sees you. Nobody deserves to go through this, especially a child like her.  On top of all this news, my sister and her husband are currently caring for a newborn baby just over a month old, so you can only imagine the hardships that have been placed on her and her family.  While the doctors say that this is curable, there is still a long road ahead. She will have to have weekly chemo treatments for a minimum of 6 months, and hopefully after that it will start to scale down.  Any donation matters in a time of need and we appreciate every single one of you! For those of you wanting to follow Tinlee’s journey, you can do so on her CaringBridge website below.

His third and most recent surgery came back with the highest aggression possible for melanoma. This gives it a 25% chance it’s in Liam’s blood stream. Once melanoma is in the blood it’s one of the fastest killing cancers. The test to find out if it’s actually in his blood costs $15k. In America, the only treatment for if it is in his blood is amino therapy which is costly $100k per year with no way of knowing how much or how long you will need it. Amino Therapy also only gives you a 50% chance that it could work which is the same percentage you have of not doing anything. The bigger better option is going to a Dr. in Spain that has a 99% success rate for cancer. This option is still not cheap costing over $20K for the treatments. Right now Liam has a trip planned for the treatments the end of May 2019 and will be gone a whole month. The treatment is not the only thing that costs money - Flights, Lodging, Food etc. My goal is to send Liam off with one less thing for him to worry about and to show him his friends and family have his back!

I asked Teri to write ""the story"" of what happened in her words (which follows below). I am attaching pictures of her beautiful Koda (pre and post surgery) as well as her vet bills for the purpose of transparency. Koda means everything to her and I know she will be thankful beyond words for any help. Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. Please share widely!  KODA'S JOURNEY BACK TO HEALTH... written by Teri I hope you will understand my decision to save Koda’s life. If you are a fellow horse lover (or cat, dog, rabbit, etc.) and have a special bond with your fur baby, you know what it feels like to love a pet… you consider them a member of your family. It is for that reason I chose to save him and not euthanize him just because he got sick. That is not what we do to family… I can still remember the very first moment I saw Koda, a 3 year old mostly white paint walk off of the horse trailer at a boarding facility where I was boarding my first horse.  As a horse lover, I’m always excited to watch a trailer come in with a new horse. What breed will it be, what is his/her use, if it’s a Draft, will the owner let me ride it, etc. I didn’t know he was a paint when I first saw him, since he was mostly white, whereas my paint at the time looked like a puzzle, which I preferred.  He appeared very fine boned compared to my stocky paint, and his tail and mane were on the thin side and not especially long. He had 1 brilliant blue eye, and the other was half blue/half brown. His name was “Roy” at the time (short for “RR Heza Royal Illusion”), but my friend (his new owner) had a few different names in mind…I voted for “Koda”.  As soon as I got to know Koda, I absolutely fell in love. His adorable personality coupled with mischievousness and amusing quirks came to be well known by other borders at the stable. Besides constantly moving his fly mask so it was cockeyed, or hanging on one ear, one of Koda’s favorite things to do out in the pasture on a warm, sunny day was lay down and snooze.   Often.  I suspect the barn manager and trainer lost count of how many passersby would pull up the long driveway to the barn just to tell them “there is a dead horse out in the pasture!”  The standard barn management response became “oh, that’s just Koda!”  Little did I know that by the next year, he would be mine.  Unfortunately, I am one of many, many women who is unable to have children, so Koda quickly became one of my “kids” (in addition to the dogs).  He’s my therapist, and I have cried in his mane more times than I can count.   He has fallen asleep with his head on my shoulder just about as often. He’s my yearly Valentine, and quite often my Friday night date.  He has outlasted boyfriends, cars, jobs, 2 moves for me, 4 moves for him and what feels like hundreds of fly masks, fly sheets and winter blankets.   He knows my car when it pulls in to the driveway (when he’s pastured) and he will be at the gate waiting for me before I have even changed into my boots and barn jacket.  He knows the sound of my car door when I close it (when he’s stalled), and he whinnies his greeting to me from inside the barn as soon as he hears my car door close.      We’d been together for several years when I went to the barn on April 23, 2018 and saw that his brilliant blue eye was green. Not a pretty-green, more an olive-green (see photo). Something was clearly wrong, so I called for an emergent vet visit. She gave us an initial protocol for 2 weeks, which included twice daily oral banamine and Neo-poly-dex ointment right in the eye, and also Dexamethasone orally once per day to suppress his immune system and Atropine eye cream as needed. I don’t remember if the word “Uveitis” was mentioned at that visit or not, but the vet stressed the importance of carefully following the protocol. At his two week follow up, things seemed to be improved, however, in another two weeks, the uveitis returned, and we again started the same protocol. After another month, things were improving, and treatment was reduced to once daily. I was relieved. Unfortunately, he had additional flare ups, each episode progressively worse, longer, and harder to treat than the previous episode and the official diagnosis was “recurrent equine uveitis”. At this time, I became desperate and started searching for anything that could help.  In addition to his veterinarian prescribed regimen, we tried other evidence-based therapies including acupuncture and essential oils. He was not getting better, and I was quickly depleting my savings. I finally had to stop so I could afford to eat. We had a very rough summer. By winter, he had been through 8 flare-ups, each progressively worse and more damaging to his eye.  I then decided to take Koda to the UW Vet School and the options were to either 1) surgically place a cyclosporine med in his eye or 2) remove the eye.   A few days before his UW appointment, I received a message from the stable owner that contained photos of the bottom of Koda’s jaw. An abscess (which we were completely unaware of) had burst.  Another emergent vet visit. An infection in the tooth root had tracked along his lower jaw and finally burst through his jaw and skin. I was referred to an equine dental specialist.  So now, in addition to twice daily meds in his eye, and continued immune suppression (thus the serious jaw infection), I had to flush this very actively infected opening several times a day as well. Exhaustion. Defeat. On January 16 we were finally at the UW Vet for recurrent equine uveitis. I was not prepared for what happened.  His eye was so bad they were concerned it might rupture, so I had to leave him there. They removed Koda’s once brilliantly blue eye the next morning.    After dealing with his eye removal and care for a few days, they turned their attention to the jaw abscess (actinomycotic osteomyelitis). We were eventually sent home with more (expensive) antibiotics and another UW Vet School appointment with the dental specialist for surgery that would eventually include tooth removal. Koda went in for his teeth extraction and bone debridement in February. Half way through the surgery, the dentist came out to talk to me. He explained the seriousness- that this had become life or death.  The infection had eaten away at his jaw bone, and they warned me that if his jaw bone fractured during this surgery, he would need to be put down. Then started one of the worst 1.5 hours of my life to date.  I had lost my first horse rather traumatically due to EPM, how could I lose Koda to anything other than old age, hopefully at least 20 years from now?   After the removal of two check teeth, curettage and bone debridement via lateral buccotomy, daily flushing of the open wound in his jaw, and a 2 week stay, I was finally able to bring Koda home.  He continues to heal, and it’s very obvious that he is starting to feel better, as he has actually started acting like a horse again, instead of a very sick patient.  While the Vet bills continue to mount (we still have follow-up appointments scheduled), seeing my boy feeling better and better, actually enjoying running and bucking in the arena… I don’t regret my decision to save him. However, trying to pay the Vet bills has taken its toll on me, drained my savings, and put me in a position where I am struggling to make my mortgage payment and other monthly bills.",1552118400,8300,0,0,https://images.gofundme.com/L0neZ8hn8ihwHw05c9NJdPKoEyE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552182549517561_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184201720450_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184234914799_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184258240142_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184370918397_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_155218438064566_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184400507825_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184431734948_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552184453485966_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552186570403917_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552186601696367_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643798_1552186685452073_r.jpeg",1020,a woman in a dress riding a horse,nan,a man riding on the back of a brown horse . a brown and white cow laying on the ground . a white horse standing next to a brown horse . a brown and white horse standing next to a wooden fence . a close up of a person petting a horse a woman is petting a horse in a stable . a white horse standing next to a wooden fence . a woman standing next to a brown horse . a close up of a box of doughnuts a close up of a keyboard and a mouse a black and white photo of a computer keyboard .
794,https://www.gofundme.com/f/david-amp-bri-macrunnel,David & Bri MacRunnel,"   February 2, 2019 David MacRunnel, our loved son, brother, nephew,    aand friend was air lifted to a trauma center with a hemorrhaging liver.  This past month and half has given all of us much to think about, a lot to be thankful for, and personally counting our blessings every single day. This frightful event came out of no where and bottom line.... how does  one prepare for such things........... bottom line is.... most of us don't. There have been lots of tests, biopsies, pokes and prods: These are some of Dave's notes I pirated from Facebook.... From Dave: So friends. I’ve got a little life update. Thankfully that includes being alive thanks to Brianne MacRunnel and the awesome med crew. I’ve joined my friends in an elite Tumor Club. It’s nestled between my  stomach and liver and apparently the jerk has resided there for awhile until a supply artery feeding the little bugger (taking name suggestions) broke. They do not know what kind it is yet and we will find out  Monday with what seems to be a very large needle. I’m (cliche) humbled to the point of tears thinking about everyone who is praying and thinking about me and sending the aloha. I’ll keep you updated on this  adventure and hopefully we’ll evict this unwanted house guest soon. Cheers and hug your loved ones. Life is pretty wild, God is good, and as my Naked and Afraid nurse told me-‘Embrace the Suck’.  More updates: So the biopsy was fun. The Eiffel Tower Of needles took 15 samples from something that looked life Grumpy dwarf. Grumpy is a GIST (gastrointestinal sarcoma tumor) and they still do not know if it’s  malignant or benign and Grumpy is in an odd place they’ve never seen. Good news is GISTs tend to be very treatable.  So now I’m at home trying to kick the Oxycodone and sleep a ton. Next appt. is with my surgeon on the 18th. Which seems pretty far away.  Thanks everyone Bri and Meredith have the unfortunate experience of being my at home nurses and they are amazing! Update 2/5: they put off the biopsy until today and I really hope it  happens because the panel of surgeons meets on Wednesday’s.  Getting a lot of walking in but having a hard time keeping my oxygen up on my own power. I’m excited to find out if this has been what has  contributed to my brain fog as well. Thanks again to everyone rallying around me - every comment means so much when things are tough  early in the morning... The nurses are all amazing. Also I’m not septic so I’m thankful for that.  Love you all - somebody take a deep breathe of fresh outside air for me. SO, this is why I decided as the ""Auntie"" to Dave and Bri to start this   GofundMe for Dave and Bri.  I will tell you...  I don't believe in starting with  ""small stuff"".  I believe in BIG or not at all.  There are many ways   we can help and providing some financial relief is just one of the ways I believe will be helpful.  Dave says this is humbling, and I'm sure it would be for any of us.  I believe each of us will want to support this amazing young man and his wife... so I've started this GOFUNDME to help show them they are so loved and we want to help.  Please help where you can, send up prayers, and by all means whatever it takes to get ""Larry"" outta the belly.... let's do it!!

EMS was called and Ralph was taken to UNC Hospital by ambulance. Since then, he has been hospitalized due to low platelet counts. He was sent home after a week but developed a bad cough. When he went to the Urgent Care a day and a half after being sent home from UNC, the Urgent Care did X-Rays and checked his blood counts. They quickly sent him by ambulance to the closest hospital where his platelet counts had dropped to 7K (normal range is 150K to 450K). Within a few hours, he was transferred back to UNC Hospitals where he has remained for the last two weeks with high risks of spontaneous bleeds.  Ralph has received many transfusions, medicines to help his body produce platelets, and IVIG treatments to help treat ITP. Unfortunately, his spleen is also playing a big role in everything. Today, they have decided that they need to proceed with ways to fix the spleen (either radiation or doing a spleen embolization).  While Ralph has been in the hospital, his wife has been by his side day and night. She went home to pack clothing and found that their heating unit had gone out. Their son had someone come look at it, only to find out that the whole unit needed to be replaced.  Between 3 ambulance rides in 3 weeks, and all but 2 nights of the last 3 weeks in a hospital having tests, medication, and blood transfusions, along with his wife living out of a hospital for 3 weeks, and having to replace the HVAC, Ralph and Kathy could use your help!  We are trying to raise enough money to cover the HVAC unit so they do not have to go home to a cold house. We would also like to alleviate some of the medical expenses, food, parking, and gas costs that have occurred and will continue to occur during this long hospital stay. His platelets are still at a dangerously low level so he will be in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time. Thank you for all your help.

Over the years this approach has led to one of the most successful programs in our community. Most people are aware how school budgets have been leaned out at the state and local level so we would like to raise funds to replace lost dollars and look forward to enhance the ""one of a kind"" baseball experience that almost no other high schools have.   Are used as long as possible.  With additional funds the uniforms could be replaced a year or two earlier to  keep the jerseys from looking tattered.   including a batting cage, additional baseballs and a mound cover.  Items that we currently have but are in need of replacement.  During an average season we go through more balls than provided. Concessions at the high school games enhance the experience.

For those who don’t know me my name is Jane Daniel Rodriguez. I am a Pre-med Kinesiology student at California State University, Los Angeles. I am one of the few who was given an opportunity to join the Study Abroad program in Japan. This opportunity presented itself to me and I had that feeling of being called for this. I am a full-time student and I do not work at the moment and I figured this would be difficult to pull off. However, I felt as though God wants me to be a part of this journey and to experience new things that will allow me not only to be a better doctor but also a better person in the future.  Study Abroad program in the University of Tsukuba, Japan entails research and laboratory works that will encompass exercise and brain fitness, neuroplasticity in spinal cord injury, jugular vein catheterization, exercise and cognition and analyzing and understanding human diseases developed from sociocultural factors. There are also other parts in the program to which we will be able to interact and collaborate with not only students from the University of Tsukuba but also with people from different parts of the world. As an aspiring Neurologist, this once in a lifetime experience will broaden my knowledge and understanding of the world of medicine and exercise. This is a really important step for me to take because I would love to encounter and meet different people who share the same passion as I do. I grew up in a poor province in the Philippines and growing up we did not have much, I decided that I will pursue my dream and become a doctor and in the future, I will give back to my home country. This opportunity will help me stand out and be unique in medical schools when it is time for me to apply. All of your kind donations will go to the expenses for the program that includes, airfare, accommodations, the registration for the program, school credit etc. . I truly appreciate any help you can give. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! I am truly grateful.

Her passing was beautiful to witness and she taught us all up until her last breath.  Any money you donate will now go towards funeral expenses and to assist her dear sister Susan.  Susan has completely devoted herself to her twin for the last 4 months.   Thank you!   Glory Dassi has been a vital part of the Taos Neem Karoli Baba Ashram for the last 25 years.  For many of those years, she was the head caretaker organizing the daily schedule and managing the ashram sevites (those who serve).   You may know Glory from her most recent post in the puja dukan/ashram store.  If you came to the ashram during the early years you would surely have found Glory making chai, cleaning the kitchen, tending to Hanuman's every need and loving every person she came into contact with.  Glory Dassi is a clear example of a selfless devotee (a person dedicated to a life of service).  She helps her community, she helps her friends, and she does it all with love and joy!  Now Glory needs our help.  After years and years of selfless service, Glory has a new adventure at hand.  In February while visiting her island home of Maui, Glory was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor.   She is now surrounded by her loving family and friends receiving amazing care.  Her spirits are high and she is currently doing everything she can to strengthen her body for the journey ahead.  As we all know, Glory has an incredible resolve to heal herself and others.   As one dear friend said to her, "" You are one of the most spiritually advanced people I have ever met.  All of your years of practice and devotion have prepared you for this moment.  I believe in you.""  And, yes, we all believe in Glory!   Glory and her team ask that from this moment on, you hold her in a vibrational field of being happy, healthy and completely healed!   Regarding Go Fund Me specifics, with health issues come expenses.   Her current simple and beautiful lifestyle requires her to generate $500 per month.  We would like to start by getting her basic expenses covered for the next 6 months.  That's a start goal of $6,000.   On top of her normal expenses come serious medical expenses.  The surgery and its protocol, alternative treatments, accommodations and transportation to Albuquerque, enhanced nutritional needs and caretaker expenses will need to be covered without stress.  With those unknowns, we are initially asking for another $4,008.  That is how we arrived at our start goal of $10,008 (we reached that goal and raised our goal to $15,500).   Your love, generosity, and positive thoughts are welcome at this time.  Glory sends oceans of gratitude to you!  With support from this campaign, Glory will rest well and begin her healing journey knowing she is loved and supported beyond belief.

Bradley Rostotski’s life tragically ended while on a trip to Mexico. What was supposed to be a happy holiday has left a journey of pain for those left behind. This loving, kind and vibrant young man meant the world to his mother Sandy, and sister Carey (Rostotski), and of course to his many friends and all who knew him. For a mother and sister, the heartache of this news is hard to fathom and is intensified by the stress of needing to suddenly plan and pay for Brad’s funeral. Further compounding the burden, is the challenge of bringing Brad’s body home from foreign soil. The financial cost of this endeavour is great, and of course just adds to the crippling pain. It is my hope that by starting this Go Fund Me campaign we can at least help ease these very real financial worries.  I am told that one never fully recovers from the loss of a child. The road ahead for the Pederson/Rostotski family will be long and painful, and while we can stand beside them, we can’t remove that grief. This Go Fund Me campaign will at minimum, allow our dear Sandy and sister Carey the time to grieve and process the shock of losing Bradley... without financial stresses. I know they will take comfort in the care expressed by friends and colleagues through these donations.  It is my great hope that together, we can raise enough money to remove the monetary pressures of this horrible situation. Please give whatever you can. No amount is too small and it will make a big difference for these dear women.  A heartfelt thank you for YOUR help in spreading the word about this fund, as well as YOUR financial contribution to help bring Bradley Rostotski, a beloved son, a treasured brother, a dear young man... home. May God bless you in your generosity.

Many of the band camp instructors will look back and smile, remembering the little girl who napped through drill in the shadow of the tower.  Fast forward 5 years and here we are, looking for a way to make Avery’s educational dream become a reality.  From beginner band with clarinet to High School playing Bassoon, from working hard for excellent scores at Solo and Ensemble to summers spent at Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, her love for the arts has flourished.  When Avery learned of a placed called Interlochen Arts Academy, she immediately expressed interest in attending and took it upon herself to apply for admission.  She was invited to attend The Winter Open House and was able to audition with the Bassoon Professor that day. While most of the day she was quiet and observant, you could feel the happiness radiating through her and the sense of peace she felt. She had finally found “her people”. As we waited anxiously for the decision date, we clung to the hope that if accepted, her financial award would cover the majority of the expense.  As small town band director and office supervisor, we knew our wages couldn’t support adding in a hefty tuition payment.  On March 8th 2019 at 5:47 PM, we received Avery’s notification email. We were all a bundle of emotions, both excited and scared at what the content may say.  My husband read aloud the words she had been waiting 6 months to hear..... “Congratulations! It is my pleasure to offer you admission to Interlochen Arts Academy. You are invited to begin your studies in Bassoon in the Fall 2019 term as a boarding student. You were selected from a highly talented group of applicants. We were impressed with your artistic achievements, talents, and experiences. Your commitment to personal and artistic excellence is of exceptional quality, and your acceptance is a testament to your hard work and passion. We believe you will play an important role in our community and thrive within our academic and artistic environment. Interlochen Arts Academy offers a transformative experience. It’s a rare place where a peer group of like-minded artists from all walks of life and from all over the world can come together to challenge each other, support each other, learn and grow. You will be immersed in an unparalleled environment, challenged by peers, and nurtured by renowned faculty. You are joining a community - a family - that spans art forms and generations. And we can’t wait to see what you will accomplish.” Tears running down her face, we let Avery have her moment, to embrace that feeling of accomplishment, of pride. Hearing her whisper, “I did it” will forever be branded in my heart    As she went off to message her friends her good news, my husband quietly spoke to me, with tears filling his eyes, telling me that her financial award wasn’t where we needed it to be to even consider sending her. Avery had received an award of  $25,000 for financial need and $5,000 for merit. While we are so thankful for the $30,000 award....our out of pocket expense is still $36,000.  We simply do not have that type of disposable income.  Here we are, two parents, reaching out to see if we can still make our daughters dream come true. She deserves this opportunity.

She had to be rushed to OSU for emergency surgery. The surgery went well and the vets untwisted her large intestines. We were hopeful all would be fixed and she would be discharged in a week and healed up in 6 months.. Sadly this was not the case. Pearl struggled with her recovery on the second day. Her heart rate elevated and she was very lethargic. By the 4th day of recovery she had stabilized but was not improving.  Day 6 a spark of hope hit.. Her heart rate lowered to normal. She was trying to eat solid foods. She was active and alert. Her bowels seemed to be functioning well again. Early Friday morning the vet check was not positive.. Her heart was racing, she was developing severe complications, and sadly she needed to be euthanized to prevent any suffering on her part.    My family mourns the loss of a great companion and friend at my daughter. Hannah is a horseman to the core, she is a incredible rider who has competed at state levels in OHSET for 4 years now.  Pearl is her gaming horse, running barrels, poles, steer daubing and was qualified to compete at state in breakaway roping this year. This loss is devastating. Hannah also is a St. Paul Rodeo princess this year. Pearl was her Grand Entry and parade horse.    We are using Gofundme to help with the almost 14,000 in vet bills that accumulated during the week in critical care. Also to give us a start on purchasing a new companion that Hannah can finish her senior OHSET season with and can ride in the many rodeos and parades she will attend the summer as a St. Paul rodeo princess.

After a lengthy negotiation with the insurance company, it has become clear that they will not honor the full value of what was lost and fail to see the inherited costs necessary to operate a business, more or less to restore it.  They are making it difficult to obtain any substantial reimbursement for my stolen property based on technicalities over what is covered and not covered. My business and my ability to support myself is at risk of being lost due to the inequitable decisions that have been determined by an insurance company.    I am so grateful for the work that I do. It is my dream to provide communities with the tools, knowledge, and resources they need to create sustainable, beautiful, and lasting garden spaces while collaborating on a shared vision to help bring families and friends outside.  To allow people to have better access to nature to appreciate and benefit from the countless ways we all benefit by interacting more with our natural surroundings.   It is difficult for me to ask for help. However, my business is at risk of being lost due to this unfortunate event.  Without the aid from the insurance, I am humbling asking for support to help recover what was stolen so that I can continue keeping my passion inline with my occupation. If there is a desire to donate that would be greatly appreciated.  There is a link provided that will show my goal to fill the gap of estimated equipment still needing replaced and cost to finance a new vehicle.

Seville is cultural center of Spain and home of legendary explorers and researchers. Combing my interests for psychology, understanding Spanish culture, and international business has brought me to seek experience in Spain.  Getting experience in Seville will not only allow for me to be more knowledgeable about Spanish traditions and ways of life but also use my psychological skills I have learned and add value to a psychological firm upon graduation. This experience also allows me to stand out from other possible candidates with skills that can only be gained through international experience, such as strong cross cultural communication and familiarity with international standards, laws, and regulations. In this experience I hope to accomplish research in international business and Spanish language and culture. I hope to show Jesus Christ in everything I do and truly experience growth in this  experience of a lifetime. In my academic study program, I will stay in Seville for 6 weeks and study with Universidad international Menéndez Peleyo-Sevilla. Here I will take classes in social psychology, Flamenco Artistic and Cultural Expression, Spanish Culture and Civilization, and Spanish language and literature.  This program is credit bearing, so at the University of Tennessee I will receive 6 hours that will go towards my Business minor and psychology major. ¡ayúdame a hacer realidad un sueño!

I am working towards raising a total of $1250 for YourStory International, and every contribution helps! The money we raise goes straight to the community we work with, allowing us to provide free primary health care to the people of Leogane, Haiti. In this community, whether it’s a donation of $5 or $50 it is making an impact! Started in 2014, YourStory International works to support and empower Haitian communities devastated by the 2010 earthquake through increasing access to medical care and economic opportunities. As a service-learning organization, we provide comprehensive, locally mediated, medical support to the people of Leogane, Haiti. YourStory is co-managed by members of the community we serve and volunteers are trained to fulfill specialized jobs throughout the trip, so the work performed by volunteers does not displace local workers. Due to the hard work and compassion of community members and volunteers, Leogane is now home to the Pont Morel Primary and Emergency Care System (PMPECS), which is the largest free, comprehensive primary care medical system in Haiti. As this is an area where it is common for people to go through their entire lives without seeing a doctor, this is a significant accomplishment! We pursue a multi-faceted approach to development by supporting economic, social, and medical well-being. Our work relies on research, outreach, and scientific evidence. We do not sponsor programs based on our perception of a community’s challenges but in response to challenges identified by community members. Our work is guided by the following values: 1. Supporting and perpetuating a global empowerment movement. 2. Promoting the health, wellness, and safety of women and children. 3. Improving access to education and employment. 4. Supporting the growth of strong, sustainable communities. 5. Delivering aid in a culturally meaningful manner. 6. Fostering personal, mutually beneficial cross-cultural relationships. It has been a longtime desire of mine to be able to make a positive difference in the lives of those who truly need it, and this expedition is providing the opportunity to do just that.

It is so important we come together for this, as some of these past due bills can acquire more and more late fees and interest.

Despite significant changes in the school population due to the recent redistricting and the addition of a new pre-school program, the teachers have come together to work as a team for the benefit of all of the students.  Their care and commitment for the students at the school is demonstrated everyday. Here are just a very few examples of the great things that are going on:  - Teachers at every grade level are helping many new immigrants learn to read and write in English. Many of these students came to our community as refugees, and our teachers have made a nurturing environment for them to thrive both personally and academically. Thank you both for your care for our new neighbors and for actively demonstrating that care for our students! - In addition to her full-time job and regularly helping to organize after-school art events, art teacher Ani Geha finds many opportunities for our students to display their creativity in the community -- from exhibiting student artwork at local museums to using their art as part of a recent street sign campaign. Thank you for going above-and-beyond to have our students contribute to the community! - Our counselor and special education teachers created a program for our developmentally-delayed students to develop their motor-skills, language-skills, math-skills, and people-skills all at once by taking orders and delivering coffee and pastries throughout the building. Thank you for showing all students how to develop abilities for success!   - Fourth-grade and Fifth-grade teacher teams identify students that excel in certain subjects, and then provide those students with enrichment activities. Thank you for making learning engaging and challenging!  As parents and fellow Sylvania citizens, we are always looking for ways to show our appreciation for all that the school does for our kids. This year for Teacher Appreciation Week in early May, the Whiteford Parent Organization will be making improvements to the Teacher and Staff Lounge.  The lounge is one of the few areas at the school where teachers can take a short break in an otherwise quite busy and hectic day. Many teachers eat their lunch (and occasionally breakfast or dinner) in the lounge before getting back to the difficult work of running a classroom. They also hold various events throughout the year in the lounge.  The lounge is one of the only areas of the building held specifically for the teachers and staff. By making the furnishings in the room nicer and modernizing the room, we are able to express that we care about them just as they care for our kids throughout the year.  Want to join us in making a difference?  Sylvania Whiteford Parent Organization is raising money for Teacher Appreciation Week, and any donation will help make an impact.

Tanzanians are forced to spend up to four hours daily to fetch water from a clean source.  This problem is especially detrimental to the women of Tanzania, for they are often assigned water collection responsibilities, which in turn harms their chance to get an education. For example, Subira Hassan was 17 when she was forced to quit school because she didn't have time to study and was so exhausted from her walks to get water.  Fortunately, there are many organizations and non-profits that assist the Tanzanian water crisis through building water wells. One of these organizations is St. Paul Partners, which provides fresh water wells for rural communities in Tanzania. The money raised will be donated to St. Paul Partners and will help build a water well in the Iringa region of southern Tanzania, an area where a very arid climate makes access to clean water very difficult.

In order to move to Canada, they were forced to be separated from their family who remain in Jordan. Coming to Canada has been a great blessing for Walaa and Kadar, but their suffering is not over as long as the family is divided.  We are raising money and seeking volunteer support to bring Walaa’s mother, father and youngest brother to Canada and reunite the family. This is a rare opportunity to contribute directly to improving the lives of 5 people displaced by an unjust and brutal war. Donations made in Canada are tax deductible.  Kadar’s wish The following is a brief account of the family’s journey from Syria to Canada. It is the true story of real people- gentle, kind people- trying to survive in a time of gruesome war.   Shortly after the war in Syria began, Walaa was 18 years old studying at the University in Damascus. She regularly witnessed gross physical abuses of her friends, neighbors and family by the government and its supporters. It was commonplace to see women, in particular, pulled off of buses and simply taken away. She lived in fear for her safety.    When a religious zealot, emboldened by the rise in violence against women, hit Walaa over the head leaving her to bleed into unconsciousness, Walaa’s father decided it was time for the family to leave the country. After a long, terrifying journey from Damascus to Jordan the family was placed in Camp Za’atari, the largest Syrian refugee camp in the world with 80,000 inhabitants in a 2 square mile space. Walaa describes the food as inedible, either rotting or full of bugs. She recalls many people dying from contaminated food and water.  Camp Za’atari, Jordan In 2013, while her husband was in Syria tending to his mother and father, Walaa had a baby girl.  Six months later her husband died in Syria.  Walaa was devastated. The support of her mother, father and brothers was the only thing that got her through those difficult days. Kadar’s grandfather, Baba as she calls him, became very close to Kadar filling the void of her father. Life in Irbid was not safe for Walaa and her family. They were constantly harassed by neighbors, employers, and landlords for being Syrian. Kadar was often attacked by Jordanian children who told her she should go back to Syria where she would get killed. Kadar would ask her mother if they could go live somewhere where there are no people so that she could be safe.  In 2018, Walaa and Kadar were granted priority status due to being a widowed mother and child. They were given passage to Canada and arrived in Ottawa in November. They have spent the past many months acclimating to their new surroundings- learning English, navigating bus routes, banks, schools, even ice skating, swimming and bike riding.  Kadar on her first scooter ride Kadar’s first skate, with her friend Charley But life has been lonely without family. Walaa worries daily about the health and safety of her aging parents and the future of her 14 year old brother who has not had access to schooling in 6 years. She wonders what would happen to Kadar if anything should ever happen to her, Kadar’s only family in the country.  And everyday Kadar asks Walaa when she will see her Baba again.   Please help us raise the funds to bring Walaa and Kadar’s family to Canada. With these funds we can give 5 people the gift of living with their loved ones, sharing life together and the peace of knowing that they are safe, together.  We have willing sponsors ready to support them in their transition but we need $24,000 CAD up front before they can be granted entrance into the country. Please consider helping in whatever way you can. All of the funds will go directly to supporting the family. Donations are tax deductible in Canada. Please let us know if you need a receipt.

839,https://www.gofundme.com/f/hilla-strong,Hilla Strong,"Hello everyone.  Some of you may know and some of you may be hearing (or reading in this case) about this story for the first time. My dad (Al) was diagnosed with cancer almost 10 years ago.  A malignant thymoma.  He has been battling it on and off since then.  He just recently had his 3rd surgery at Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh PA on Wednesday March 13th 2019.  He had multiple tumors removed from his heart, lungs, diaphragm, and esophagus.  He also had a HIPEC procedure performed.  He spent about a week in the hospital after a back to back surgery (March 13th and 14th to complete everything).   Once my Dad got home it seemed everything was going...ok.  But then things took a turn for the worst and he went to the ER in Erie PA where he was then transported back to Presbyterian Hospital by ambulance.  He then had surgery again to have tubes placed in his chest which drained over 2 pints of fluid.  The tubes are still there to prevent fluid accumulation in his chest cavity.  My mother has been taking off work multiple days, going unpaid to stay as much as she can with my Dad.   If anyone knows my Dad he is not the one to say anything is wrong, his usual response to if he is in pain or what is going wrong is ""I'm fine, I'm fine"".  Or if it's a questions about anything he directs it towards my Mom as she remembers his meds, previous procedures, what's been going on, etc.  She is his life line.   With my Dad now being back at Presbyterian Hospital which is 2 hours away from where my parents live in Edinboro PA, it's difficult for my Mom to travel back and forth to be with him.  She can't really take off work anymore because there are bills to pay.  But I know she needs to be there for my Dad so he gets the treatment and care he needs.  Please help us out in this aspect. My Dad is my everything along with my sisters.  And my daughter's, his only grandchild, who is 3 years old.  He is a wonderful husband, father, brother, friend, coworker (mind you he was still working full time throughout going to all his previous treatments - chemo included, WOW!).  He even served this great country in the United States Air Force for 23 years.  He means so much to so many people.   My family is the type of family who would do anything for anyone.  Please help my parents out.  These donations will go to helping out for bills, so my Mom can take off work to be with my Dad, and not have to worry.  Pay for travel expenses back and forth from Edinboro PA to Pittsburgh PA.  And all the little details people don't think about, such as parking, food, etc. Please help, it would be GREATLY appreciated. If you ever want to know more about my Dad's story, or our family's please feel free to reach out to me.

Let me introduce my family and I and tell you that God is moving in our family and we want to join in making a difference.  Rebecca and I (Erik) have been married for 10 years this year and we have 5 amazing children ranging from the age of 11 to 1 year, and we have recently been called for missions throughout the country and the world; and today we are excited to share with you Rebecca’s first destination to help in spreading the word and lead children.  We are raising money for the annual Mexico Mission trip with Lighthouse Church, and for OUR FIRST mission trip. Any donation will help make an impact. Because we have been called to serve Puebla, Mexico, this August 2019, we need to plan to get her there and that is where your initial support can help.  As you can imagine, a trip like this requires financial support and we would be grateful for you to join in that effort. The total trip will cost $1,500, and our goal is to raise the first half of the funds by May 1, 2019 to secure the flight and the remaining balance no later than August 1, 2019. While attending the trip Rebecca will be under the direction of Associate Pastor of Lighthouse and the youth group (Verge) as we participate in a community outreach program including:             “I love kids, and as of today I am a substitute teacher in one of my local church preschools. I’ve taught and invested weekly providing students the necessary tools in learning, while also spreading the love of God over them as they attend classes. Now I’d like to be a little more outward focused and seize opportunities to serve outside my comfort zone. I can’t wait to run around roaring like a lion, telling kids bible stories like Daniel in the Lion’s Den. I hope they change me for the better as I serve them, just maybe they’ll be changed too…and hopes that I can have them be forever changed in God’s word. Other than asking you for help, we have coordinated events for extra cash we both have picked up a part time jobs. What kind of Christian would I be if I didn’t act on something I have a conviction for? Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this amazing opportunity. We are fully committed to growing, spreading the word, and leading those we come in contact with honor, dignity, and respect. Please help us in reaching our first goal as we move on this calling to impact others.  Blessings, Erik & Rebecca Scott We promise to only use these funds for missions.

841,https://www.gofundme.com/f/lew039s-60-for-60,Lew's 60 for 60,"  I'm celebrating 60 years of life this spring by running a marathon to benefit King's Home, and any donation will help make impact.    During spring break of 2018, a family discussion began about me running a marathon for my 60th birthday. After much joking and challenging, I decided to try it.  As this running adventure progressed, doing it for a purpose became paramount. After a year of struggling and fighting to stay open, this past December we had to make the heart wrenching decision to close the doors of our King’s Home Tuscaloosa (KHT) campus for women and adult moms with children fleeing domestic violence. This was the result of losing our 30 year partnership with America’s Thrift Stores who was bought out by a San Francisco venture capital group. They ended our funding in December of 2017—a $750,000 annual loss to King’s Home. I was really impressed to run for King’s Home mission. We desperately need the money.   Running has never been a passion; rather an occasional outlet in recent years. Of course, I ramped up to train back in August. It is satisfying to be in better shape. That’s an important part to taking care of our body, mind and spirit.   Well, I’m turning 60 on March 21st, so running a marathon seemed to be a worthy goal.   Finish the race and raise $60,000 for the youth, moms and kids of King’s Home. SoCal Marathon, March 2. This was the only race that fit family schedules so that I could have the support of running with my daughter and son-in-law.   We’ll be documenting my journey on Facebook and Instagram along with our website. You can help me spread the word by sharing with your friends. We’ll be using the hashtag #lews60for60. If you’re a runner, I’d love to hear from you and learn some of your favorite meals, training routines, gear, methods…everything! What about a sports doctor to evaluate my training? Even a nutritionist to help me with the right training diet! Or, potential donors to cover race expenses? Let me hear from you!   For over 45 years, King's Home has been home to thousands of abused youth, women and children seeking refuge from abuse, violence, homelessness, and other extreme and impoverished conditions. Or mission is to provide safe homes in which compassion and competence combine to meet the needs of those we serve. We provide everything they need to heal from their past and start over in life.

As the Center works toward a culture of peace, one of its key objectives is to cultivate the story of us in order to uproot the division sown by today’s political climate. The Center’s primary focus is on peace education for youth, the peace leaders of today who can guide us into a new tomorrow.  Voices of Peace intends to work with 10 high school students in the Worcester community. Students will work with one staff member from the Center and one senior from Doherty High School to develop their personal narratives and promote their stories of peace. This project arose two years ago as a response to the use of social media in escalating fights among students. The objective of the Voices of Peace program is to encourage students to use media in a positive way and to assist them in honing their voice in order to become agents of social change by developing their stories of self, stories of us, and stories of now.  The 10 students involved in the program will each work with the program facilitators to produce a 3-5 minute video sharing their personal narrative which will be disseminated on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

He was hit by a car Saturday afternoon and left to die. Luckily dingo drug himself Home and we have been helping him get better since. I received some devastating news yesterday about our boy dingo -... after some xrays we found that dingos hip is shattered in 3 places. The procedure is going to cost well over $3000 and unfortunately we can not swing that at this time. This will be for a specialist to insert plates on his hip. The doc said this will not heal on its own and the only other option is to lay him to rest or amputate his leg. If we amputate he said there is a possibility he’ll never be able to run again.. he’s only 7 months old and I feel like it would kind of be selfish to take his leg because Dingos favorite past time was to run in our yard just playing with whatever or whoever he found. He was the most joyful dog I’ve ever meet and loved everyone he laid eyes on. This boy is apart of our family. He literally is the best dog I’ve ever had. He loves his family so much but unfortunately since he was hit he has lost his joy. He spends his days laying around in pain and whimpering. I stay up with him all throughout the night and he’s miserable. If anyone could help us out by donating for his surgery we would greatly appreciate it.

He quickly woke his wife, Paula, and she helped to get their two young daughters, Claire & Abagail (my precious grandaughters), out of the house. Cam stayed inside to attempt to fight the fire and save their home. However, he was overcome by the noxious smoke and fell unconscious until Paula rushed back in to rouse him and help him out of the house where their daughters waited in the cold. We are forever grateful that their lives were spared, and since that day, the local outpouring of generosity around their home near Santa Claus, Georgia (just south of Lyons, GA), has helped to replace some of the little girls' lost Christmas gifts and clothing. However, their house was a total loss, as was the entire content and all of their possessions. While Cam's new job once provided for their needs as a young family, this major setback has overwhelmed them financially. Cam's employer has offered housing at a cost that will be deducted from his pay, but the house is not furnished. Their present and persistent need is monetary. They will need to purchase beds and bedding as well as other furniture and furnishings for the house they are living in. Their little girls will need things that were not among those things donated by friends and family. Please help this sweet family with this urgent need in a meaningful however you can.

Consequences : - severe anemia (need each month for blood transfusion) - enlargement of the liver and spleen￼ with pain  If left untreated, it will lead to death within the first decade of life, Vilao is already 8 years old.  Unfortunately, the blood transfusion can't change their life expectancy. The family has been looking for treatment options for quite some time now, and this is what the outcome is:   There is 1 shot with surgery for each of them to reduce the inflammation of their stomach.  The surgery is scheduled for January 20th 2019 in Vientiane, Laso for both Vilao and his little sister Shaxi with an international team of surgeons, and  which is located about 1 day of drive time from their home.  Heritage Studio is organizing this campaign in hopes that enough money can be raised so that Vilao and Shaxi can have the chance to grow up and see better tomorrows.  Facts about Vilao and Shaxi:  Vilao is 8 years old, and he is extremely talented with embroidery ""paj ntaub"". He works so fast and does such wonderful job...unfortunately he is only paid a ridiculous amount of 10 Lao kip for each finished product which is literally NOTHING!   10 kip= 0.00116817USD IN ORDER TO EARN JUST $1.00, HE WOULD HAVE TO EMBROIDER 1,000 PIECES....YET THIS IS HIS ONLY WAY OF EARNING A BIT OF $$$ FOR MEDICAL TRESTMENT FOR HIMSELF AND HIS LITTLE SISTER, So he dedicates all his time to help villagers embroider for the buyers in the U.S and other countries.  Shaxi and Vilao are inseparable! She follows him and stays by his side all the time! She doesn't talk much, but adores her brother, and he is very protective of her as well.  I sincerely hope that TOGETHER we WILL help these 2 children to GO THROUGH SURGERY FOR THE CHANCE  AT GROWING UP.  They so deserve it, and every bit helps!  Thank you so very much!

She started drinking lots of water and stopped eating, which for anyone that has a puggle knows is very strange.  We went to the vet and she was initially diagnosed with pancreatitis, but a week  later after no improvement the vet is afraid she may have pancreatic cancer.  The only way to confirm the diagnosis is thru ultrasound, which initially will be at least $500.  Since the death of my husband I have been on a very limited income, and unfortunately do not have the money for this procedure, let alone any follow up treatment. I am trying to sell various items to raise money for Kona, but I fear time is growing short and I want to do everything I can for her, since she has always been there for me, unconditionally.

He and his campaign team urgently need your help. Elements in the US government are aggressively pressuring Ecuador to withdraw his asylum status -  Since 2010 the US government has pursued a secret Grand Jury investigation into WikiLeaks and the US government has already charged Assange in a sealed indictment. These charges are an attack on freedom of speech and the right to publish.  If Assange is to be persecuted for publishing truthful information, then other news organizations and even individuals could be next.   The bringing of criminal charges against Julian Assange for publishing is an extremely dangerous path for a democracy to take. The CIA has openly said that it is working to ""take down"" WikiLeaks following its release of thousands of files on the CIA – the largest leak of CIA documents in history. In April 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that arresting Assange was a priority while then CIA Director Mike Pompeo said:  The US government will use all its resources to force Assange’s extradition from the United Kingdom and bring him into US custody. By contrast,  and relies on personal donations to promote its journalism, which has a 100% record of accuracy. Human Rights organizations are completely opposed to Assange’s extradition while the United Nations has repeatedly called for his safe passage to another country.

860,https://www.gofundme.com/f/birthday-gift-for-catherine,Birthday Gift For Catherine!,"My friend Catherine Williams is a very special person with many incredible gifts, as I’m sure many of you already know! One of which is that she is a passionate, dedicated, assiduous advocate of early education for young children.  She has been teaching at The Suzuki School for the past  5 years, where she is the lead teacher for Pre-Primary school-aged children, though she has worked with all ages from birth to pre-K. While dedicating herself to this work full-time, Catherine has worked very hard to earn her Infant/Toddler Montessori Teacher Certification credentialed by the American Montessori Society. She is also currently pursuing her Master’s degree in Montessori Education. Aside from these endeavors, Catherine also shares her passion with other educators as a Teacher Assistant Trainer for the Suzuki School. Outside of her work and studies, Catherine continually outpours her passion and care for young children and families. She provides private care for children and families that have come to know and trust her, and she also plans and coordinates many baby showers, bridal showers, and other special events for friends and family. Ask anyone who knows Catherine if they trust her advice and expertise in child development and education and the answers would all be a tremendous “Yes!” Some of you have already attested to this trust in her by making her Godmother to your children - Catherine has FOUR godchildren! This February 1st is a special date for Catherine in two ways - one is because it is her birthday! And the other is because it is the weekend of a very special conference that she has shared with me a great interest in attending. It is called Parent-Infant Community Training and will be in Boulder, Colorado the weekend of February 1-3 ( ). The purpose of this training is to learn how to start a class whose goal is to educate parents and provide them an opportunity to learn effective parenting skills and create healthy routines from early on while their children are still young. For a few years now, Catherine has spoken to me about her desire to move beyond the classroom in helping to support the healthy development and education of young children by working directly with the parents to provide them with tools and training to make a bigger impact. This fundraiser is to support Catherine’s vision and to help her begin this project she’s had stirring inside her for some time now. One of the most amazing things that I’m sure you admire about Catherine as much as I do is how she continues to seek growth in herself and her education. I know how much she wants to attend this conference and I want nothing more than to pay her way to go! All she needs to worry about is taking in all she can to continue pursuing her dreams and to be able to play the part she intends to for her community. As friends, family, and colleagues of hers, I would like to invite you to share with me in giving Catherine the Parent-Infant Conference as a joint birthday gift. The cost of the conference is $400, so I am hoping together we can give $1,000 to also cover her airfare, hotel, and food. Please feel free to share the link with other people who may know Catherine and would like to show their love and support for her birthday. BUT please keep this a SECRET!!! I have not shared this with her and would like it to be a surprise! In order to give her enough time to register and buy her plane ticket, I’ve made the fundraiser 10 days long. Once the end date arrives, my hope is that we’ll have met our goal and will then share the page with Catherine to show her this gift from all of us who love and support her.

Wind conditions immediately set the house ablaze as he ran inside to help his wife, the family dog, and other family members escape. They were lucky to get out without injury before the house was engulfed and destroyed.  Now 71, our dad has lived a life of service: alter boy for his church in Queens, NY; he served his country in Vietnam; married and had two daughters with his wife Catherine; opened an automotive business in his Long Island community; took care of his elderly parents. He was always offering to lend a helping hand to colleagues, neighbors, and friends. When his wife of 34 years was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer at 56 years old, he spent every day of her final eight months afterward caring for her and being strong for his daughters.  He found love again with his new wife, Theresa, and together they renovated their home, but that happiness was cut short when our dad was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in early 2018. Theresa cared for him through his chemo and radiation treatments this past spring and summer, rejigging his diet and using holistic remedies to strengthen him through treatments, which he just completed barely 3 months ago. And now he's lost his home. So many generous people have asked what they could do to help. Right now they need the necessities for daily life and work: clothes, jackets, shoes, daily toiletries, and their prescription meds. In the coming months, they'll navigate insurance and contractors to try to rebuild a new home on that half acre, and then they'll need everything to set up a house: beds, sheets, pots and pans and dishes.  Priceless things were lost that can never be replaced, such as photos of our mother and all our grandparents, our grandfather's buriel flag and WW2 medals, our father's army pics and uniform and medals.

She has since been undergoing potent chemotherapy that has rendered her too ill to continue working at this time.   In addition to fighting for her life, Jenn is fighting her health insurance company as they deny paying for pre-authorized treatment, and refuse to pay for necessary testing and immunotherapies, prescribed by her doctors.  At the time of writing this campaign, Jenn is well over $50,000.00, in medical debt that continues to grow.   Despite not knowing how she is going to pay for her medical treatments; Jenn's main concern at this time is her family's basic necessities, like keeping a roof over their heads, the lights on, and food on the table.   Jenn is a vivacious, quick witted, hilarious, hard working, loyal, and caring young woman.  I have been blessed to call her friend for the last decade.  Jenn's husband, James, and two (2) young sons, Austin, and Chris, continue to take great care of her as she thrives and  wins her battle. However, like a lot of families, Jenn's is one that is dependent on two (2) incomes.  With only her husband's income, ends have been hard to meet.   Jenn has finally been approved for disability but her first benefit check will not come until May.  Jenn's family has approximately $2,000.00 in bills that must be paid a month.   We are asking for help to ease some of the financial burden Jenn's family is enduring until she receives her disability benefits.

That year he had a left nephrectomy (kidney removed), and was told that his cancer was encapsulated. In 2016, Sean started having severe leg pain, and was found to have a tumor on his left femur. Once again he was taken into surgery, had the tumor removed, and a cadaver bone placed. Sean did well for about a year and a half. In 2018, he was having some pain in his leg again, and afraid of the outcome, put off the doctor visit. He suddenly had a sharp pain with sound like a ""crack"". It was found at that time that the cadaver bone placed in his left femur actually never took, which caused a shattering of his femur. His third surgery was to place a rod in hopes to stabilize his left leg. A couple months later, Sean started having severe back pain. Thinking that this was just because the way he was walking it was putting a strain on his back. So he went home to Georgia, as planned for Christmas. When he returned the pain had not subsided, and seem to only be worsening, he had an MRI. Sean just found out he now has Stage IV metastatic renal cell carcinoma of his T4 vertebrae that has caused a compression fracture. After meeting with the neurosurgeons, he also discovered that it is not only on the vertebrae, but also surrounding his spinal cord. He is not able to have radiation until it is at least 1 cm away from the spinal cord, or he would risk paralysis from the mid chest down. Knowing the surgery was also a risk, he has decided to go ahead with the surgery.  This has all caused emotional, physical and financial hardship for him and his wife. Since Sean has been fighting cancer, leg fractures, and his father in-law is also on hospice, his wife has exhausted all her PTO and is having a hard time keeping the family financially above water. Every little bit will go so far for this family. Help support Sean through this hard time. All prayers are, of course, welcomed.

On January 26th, members from both groups met in Kirksville to assess the current state of affairs of the fraternity.  We touched on several topics, including recruitment, finances, and the house. After a lengthy discussion, the group’s members made a unanimous decision to sell the chapter house.  While there are still many details to work through, the hope is to sell the house as soon as possible after the conclusion of the current school year.   In its current state, the house has become a burden for the chapter. It affects our ability to recruit because of its condition and location.  Financially, recent bills have also set the fraternity back. Last winter, the heating system in the house failed and the roof was replaced.  The major repairs cost the fraternity more than $25,000.  Additionally, in recent years, Colonel paid out of his own pockets to cover some of these repairs to the house. While the long-term goal will be to acquire or build a house closer to campus, the chapter may not have a house for the foreseeable future.  We believe, based on feedback from actives and recruitment trends, a house closer to campus will help us in the end.  Other organizations on campus have used this model before and been successful. In order for the chapter to reach its goals, we are calling on the rest of the alumni base to honor the commitment each of us made at initiation.  We ask that you consider helping pay back Colonel, help offset some of the current expenses the chapter faces due to the house and build a fund to secure a bigger and better house for future Phi Taus.  We appreciate any gifts or donations made to the chapter on your behalf. This is the beginning of a long process for the chapter, but we are confident it will lead to a more successful chapter in the future.  We also hope our endeavor rallies more alumni to consider helping the chapter out, whether that is through the BOG or Housing Corporation.  If you have any questions about our decision regarding the house or about the current state of affairs, please feel free to contact one of us.

That is how this story starts because it’s about one of my first foster puppies- Bam Bam. In September 2016, six of the most adorable pibble  puppies arrived at the Rescue and I brought home two. Bam and his brother had the most striking eyes I’d ever seen and Bam’s fur color(“blue”)set him apart even more. They were too young to leave foster care immediately, but I knew they’d probably go quickly once they were old enough. The Delcid family applied for and ultimately chose Bam Bam. The whole family were/are great and so in love with this beautiful, chill, playful, and loving pup. I remember thinking at the time I was so excited for him to go to an obviously loving home with three great kids! I have stayed in touch since then and always enjoy the pics of Bam and his kids. It’s a special thing kids have with their dogs and that’s a huge part of why I’m starting this campaign for the family. At just 2 1/2 years old, Bam bam was just diagnosed with lymphoma and while I know they want to do anything and everything possible to help him, including ask for help, I know it’s hard emotionally and financially to fight the fight. They are allowing me to start this campaign for them just to ease the burden and help out a little. Frankly, I cannot bear the idea of such a young dog dying because of this stupid disease,but what breaks my heart more is that these kids are potentially going to lose one of their best friends. Certainly they can survive it, because they have great parents, but they really shouldn’t have to. Lymphoma isn’t an easy cancer to beat and it certainly isn’t cheap. It took about a month of testing and sickness just to get the Dx, so it’s already been pricey.   They are just getting started with an oncologist, so there is still a lot to do. Based on some Googling, I think a reasonable estimate for the cost of treatment is $10,000. As we get more information from vets, we can adjust as needed, but just to get the ball rolling, I’m starting there. Please consider helping out.

887,https://www.gofundme.com/f/bonnies-spleen-surgery-and-recovery,Bonnie's Spleen Surgery & Recovery,"Bonnie wrote to me after receiving a particularly scary medical diagnosis. That was the moment I decided to create this GoFundMe—because no one ever have to worry over money while they’re fighting for their life. I know Bonnie only through the hound dog Facebook group she moderates, and through the posts she shares. In spite of this, a few of things in my year of knowing her are clear: One, she is a vivid, strong, compassionate woman who finds humor even in the bleak. Two, she has a deep love of her animals and her family.   Bonnie first fell on hard luck when a freak accident involving a dog bite to her hand and arm stole her career as a veterinary assistant. Not only did she lose the ability to do what she was passionate about, it was also only the beginning of her worries. —suffering from a spectrum of medical challenges including breathing difficulties, chronic pain, and now her latest and most frightening diagnosis yet: a CAT scan revealed multiple aneurysms to her spleen.   The mortality rate is high, the surgery is serious, and Bonnie will very likely lose her spleen. Regardless of the surgery’s outcome, recovery is also difficult.  To make matters worse, Bonnie’s husband Todd is completely out of time off and working non-stop. This isn’t out of inadequate planning. Bonnie was supposed to have one surgery in the fall, but struggles with her health meant she required two additional surgeries.   Even the medications and treatments that are covered come with hefty copays. Allergies to many oral antibiotics make matters even more complicated and limit her options. So I’m imploring you—if you are an animal lover, a parent, a grandparent, or a child… consider helping Bonnie. She is all of these things and more. She has so many people in her corner and so much living left to do—and she and her family deserve to come out the other side of this without extreme financial duress.  - Pet care for Bonnie’s sweet dogs and cats - Day nurses to help while Todd can’t be home - Medications and other treatments - Cooked meals and other general around-the-house help - Stair ramps for the porch - A step to help Bonnie get in her truck So no matter how small, even a donation of $5, please consider helping out with Bonnie’s recovery fund. Every little bit of help counts. Thank you, and if you cannot donate, please share and help this wonderful woman and her family get through a scary time!",1549526400,1500,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/rRAA72Pb8So-3PGfZwla7w-PIO4=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549592202174765_r.jpeg,"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598377376609_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598789331198_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598506863878_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598596715130_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598678342163_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598698677114_r.jpeg,https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912568_1549598935703798_r.jpeg",1155,a woman wearing a tie and a hat .,nan,a woman wearing a tie and a hat . a woman in a white shirt and a red tie a young man wearing a tie and glasses . a man and woman pose for a picture . a man sitting on a couch with a dog . a man is standing in front of a window a man and a woman posing for a picture .

Thanks to one of the many wonders of social media, I found  a program called GLA (Global Leadership Adventures). GLA allows teens in high school to go to a foreign country and do an array of programs. The program I have chosen will allow me to travel to Belize in Central America. There, I will lead an educational English camp for Belizean youth, use experiential learning tools, to improve the children's literacy, and learn about Belize and their animal conservations. While teaching the children, I will gain 30 hours of community service towards my graduation. I would also get to explore Belize through hiking, snorkeling, spending time in the community learning about their culture, and other amazing expeditions that one could only dream of. In order to move forward and completely secure my spot for this program, the program final payment is due May 1St. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any and all donations that are helping me reach my goal to achieve my dream; I am internally grateful.",1549526400,5000,9,0,https://images.gofundme.com/r2qYCcNYfdIk630Qe54y5nGd9Ww=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36912552_1549592248547970_r.jpeg,,355,a little girl brushing her teeth with a pink toothbrush .,nan,

I left home at 18 and have been moving around the country for the past 19 years. I moved to Fresno in July 2017 and immediately had trouble finding work. I did eventually land a position with a company making minimum wage and stayed there for a little over a year. I took a chance in October and landed myself a temp to hire position finally making a living wage and little did I know that they were hiring almost 100 temps to eventually fill less than 20 spots. Needless to say, I made it though multiple rounds of layoffs only to finally be let go myself. I was advised on January 18th that my assignment with what I thought was going to be my next perm job had ended. This left me without work and no way to pay the bills. I am done running and moving from state to state and city to city. It is time to go back home to Chino where there are more job opportunities and where I can live with the support of my family. There are other reasons why I have chosen to head back home as well. One of those reasons is to be able to help my sister with the care of our disabled parents. The problem I am facing is that I am defaulted on my truck loan and she is in such disrepair that she wouldn't make it thru the Grapevine to get down to Southern California so I am forced with needing to turn her back in to the car lot I bought her from.

Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN).   Tuesday 5th February, a video surfaced on social media of a carriage horse in Java being badly beaten by it's owner, location unknown.  The team at JAAN relentlessly pursued until they found & rescued the  horse 2 days later.  The horse is now under veterinary care and confiscated from it's owner who fled the area.  However, his name and address have been supplied.  More to come on this.  In 2018.  POI worked with JAAN to free 2 orangutans, Jono and Otan, plus a Sun bear, Buddy, who had been incarcerated at a government facility for many years.  All 3 are now well cared for at sanctuaries.  After a 5 year long campaign, JAAN succeeded in 2013 to have laws put in place to ban dancing monkeys in Jakarta & now nation wide as well. They created the Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition in 2017, receiving  amazing support from national & international celebrities such as Ricky Gervais who have lent their voice to Indonesia’s dogs & cats!   JAAN are currently campaigning to stop travelling dolphin shows in Indonesia.  They are also fighting hard to stop the hydro dam in Sumatra, which threatens to wipe out the recently discovered Tapanuli orangutan (the most critically endangered orangutan). During earth quakes and volcanic eruptions on the Indonesian islands. JAAN never hesitate to enter the danger zones to rescue, feed and provide aid for the animals and humans left behind.  They are also training specialised sniffer dogs to detect illegal wildlife smuggling at docks and airports.    The work of JAAN is extensive and never ending.  So much so that we cannot list it all.  It extends to all creatures great and small.  From sterilization programs for stray cats and dogs.  Rescuing bears, orangutans, monkeys, birds, crocodiles, dolphins, horses, turtles, dogs, cats etc, the list goes on. JAAN have recently been approved to build a new Wildlife Center on the Island of Sumatra.    This organisation have never asked POI for funds for their own work.  So we have decided to set up this campaign to help them.  The money raised will be used for anything they need, and will let them decide where it's needed most.   As a trustworthy organisation, we know it will be put to good use.  Please take a look at their website to see some of the amazing work they do.     We love you JAAN.

We took him to our primary veterinarian at the Philadelphia Animal Hospital and after running several tests they discovered he was severely anemic and he was transferred to UPenn Veterinary hospital's ER.     The funds we're asking for are to help cover the  as of right now. We're currently looking at close to six thousand dollars ($6,000) and we would give anything to help him, but that is  . Whinston was an extremely healthy cat before this and it has taken a huge toll on our family emotionally more than anything. The shock alone is really tearing on our soul.  When our family was weak, he came along and brought us together. Whinston was a feral cat who lived in the alley of the home we had just moved in to. Before him we would fight  constantly, this is a family that has been torn apart by poverty, we grew up homeless most of our lives, couch surfing at friends and families homes. Now we had a new home of our own, but it was still empty, the hurt was still there. Until this little White and Gray kitty came along, our Whinston.      Feeding and caring for this small stray gave us something to bond over, and in a matter of a few months we had brought him into our home to live with us indoors.  He purrs when you look at him. He comes when called. You'll never be alone in a room by yourself because Whinston rushes to keep anyone and everyone company.  He demands pets and is constantly ready to be held and loved. Even all his nurses and doctors at the university adore him because all he wants is to give cuddles.      While Whinston is not just an important member of our family, he is also extremely therapeutic for us as well. Coping with the loss of our loved ones and learning to communicate as a unit was all helped along from him. Although he provides the most therapy to the youngest member of our family, my ten (10) year old sister, Madisyn.        Madisyn was diagnosed with Autism, along with other mental handicaps and a growth disorder. She is on feeding tubes because her body blocks her from getting nutrients and she doesn't make any hormones to know when she's hungry. Although she is ten (10), she has the mental maturity of a five (5) year old. It's hard for her to understand why she's so different from other children her age. But Whinston is always there. Whenever she has a meltdown or experiences sensory overload, Whinston is there to lay on her lap and purr until she calms down. Focusing on him helps her cope with the busy and confusing world around her. He follows her, sits by her desk while she does homework, and occasionally smacks her pencil to help out. He lets her squeeze and hug him while she gets her feeding tube changed (Which can be very painful) and he doesn't fuss a bit during any of it.               I know this is very long, and I appreciate everyone who took the time to read this and who will be generous enough to help. Words could never describe in full how much he means to us. I could write a million books and still never get close to explaining the love we have for him.

Sadly Crystelle lost her best friend, her dog Bailey, due to the severity of how bad the accident was.    Crystelle spent over 14 days at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston and suffered from multiple injuries. From 4 broken ribs, fractures in her neck and spine, torn ligaments and muscles throughout her neck and back. She also suffered from a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) which subsequently put her in the hospital for the second time. Crystelle went through hell and back having not only one, but three separate chest tubes being placed inside of her chest to help reinflate her lung.    Thankfully Crystelle does have private health insurance, but she will still be up to her knees drowning in medical debt due to the amount of time she spent in the Hospital, her medications, all the X-Rays, MRI's and CT scans that were taken, the cost of having an invasive surgery, and the expenses of her Hospital bed at home and the neck & back brace she now is required to wear.    It's become apparent to her and her family that it's going to be extremely difficult to be able to afford all of her medical bill's on her own. She has been out of work for over a month now and anticipates at least another two months of not being able to work. She also will have to finance another vehicle due too the total loss of her car from the accident.    Crystelle and her family have been through so much these past few months and they still have a long road to recovery. They would appreciate any sort of help or donations towards their upcoming expenses.    The family also plans on having a benefit in the near future to help raise money for Crystelle's expenses.

903,https://www.gofundme.com/f/chad-daugherty-cancer-fund,Chad Daugherty Cancer Fund,"(Whats wrong?) This past Tuesday Chad (37 yrs) was diagnosed with a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST).   A GIST (pronounced “jist”) is a type of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract.  Some grow slow and others are more aggressive.  His tumor is presently the size of a fist and malignant (CANCER).  It's genetic but rare in someone his age.  (How bad is it?) Finding the tumor was the good news.  This disease was once nearly impossible to cure before newer treatments were developed.  If properly treated the 5 year survival rate is good for this type of cancer.  What we know for now is that left untreated Chad will most likely die by Christmas, however there is HOPE.   GISTs are not typically treated the same way as most cancers.  Surgery is a possibility but the tumor's growth has to be arrested and ideally shrink before surgery is a viable option.  The medicine to shrink the tumor is insanely expensive. (The obstacle!) The direct out of pocket cost (not covered by insurance) of the specific medicine needed to shrink the tumor cost about $5000 a month and he needs to take it for 6-8  weeks prior to surgery.   The entire cancer protocol (treatment) will consist of medicine and surgery followed by more medicine.   Frankly Chad can't afford to fund the fight without help.  Chad's total out of pocket cost for the next 6-8 weeks is expected to exceed $25,000 and beyond that we can only speculate.   Chad is 37 years old and a 1999 graduate of Adel-DeSoto-Minburn High School in Adel, IA, a  2002 graduate of The Worldwide College of Auctioneering,  a 3rd generation auctioneer conducting over 150 auctions per year. He performs  20+ charity auctions annually for groups like Joppa Outreach for the Homeless in Des Moines, plus auctions for Children Families of Iowa and many other local charities.   Chad is Lifetime sponsor of Ducks Unlimited, a lifelong resident of Adel and a respected auction professional.   More important than all of these,  he is a father of a 14 year old son, Dausen with sole custody and survival for this reason alone is worth the fight at any cost. He was recently engaged to Crystel Harrison who has been faithfully by his side through out these recent unexpected  life challenges.    Chad is a hard working, responsible,  young man that is too young to die.  Asking for help is foreign to him.  He is proud and  has always been the one helping others.  Taking or not taking the medication to shrink the tumor should not be decided based on whether he can afford it. If Chad takes the medicine the tumor will shrink and then surgery becomes possible.  When he completes the cancer protocol his survival rate improves dramatically and he can hope to return to a normal productive life caring for his family. We are respectfully asking you to consider helping us raise the funds to cover his medicines, tests, doctor & hospital visits for the net 6-8 weeks.  If all of his friends and family would give something, no matter the size, plus promote this fund raiser by sharing it on Facebook or other social media platforms then  we can easily and affordably share his burden . Chad says that ""no matter what happens I have lived a great life and wouldn't change a thing"".   Lets come together and help him live to see his son grow up and help him continue to serve the people of Iowa through his profession.  Chad needs to start this medicine NOW and the clock won't stop while we think about it!  Please act now!  Thank you for caring!",1552118400,28000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/cvBJKpv_-KT3WATlN3ICPoeR4RA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643536_1552182101118602_r.jpeg,,21369,a man and a woman posing for a picture .,nan,

My name is Carmen Horner, and as many may know, our family suffered a devastating loss on November 1, 2017 with the murder of my younger brother, Cody Henderson.  Cody was a husband, father of three beautiful children, son, grandson, brother, uncle, cousin and so much more to a huge family of people whom love him deeply. In the aftermath of losing him to violence, our family has not only had to cope with the grief and heartache, but also stay on top of updates regarding his case. It has been a very long almost year and half waiting for justice for Cody, waiting for the closure, solace and peace of mind that comes with knowing his death will not go unpunished. Our healing may never truly feel whole and complete, but justice will undoubtedly make the pain quieter and that gaping wound a little smaller. That time is finally here, and now we need some help. Cody's case proceedings are taking place in Utah due to the fact that his life was taken while he was away for work, even missing Halloween night with his wife and children to be a hardworking man that provided for his family no matter the cost. Unfortunately, travelling expenses are a mountain to cross due to Utah and West Virginia being over 1,000 miles apart. Between airfare, transportation, hotels, and all the expenses that accompany travelling so far, my family is struggling to raise the money amidst already hard times. It means more to me than words could possibly express that I am able to be there in person to see my little brother get justice.  Help me be there for him one last time, help me stand up for my little brother one last time, and help me to protect him in the only way that I still can- by ensuring that the full weight of the law comes down on the man who took his life. Your donation will be used to ensure that all loved ones who want to be in three weeks, will get to be there to support Cody one last time.

After bloodwork, xrays, and a CT scan it was determined that his appendix needed to be removed. A quick surgery, and he’d be recovering at home the next day and back to work in two weeks, much to our relief.  However, on February 19th he got a phone call from his surgeon asking that he come in the next day. A little suspicious, but figured it was just a routine follow up appointment. On February 20th his doctor told him that he had cancer, which was what caused the appendicitis, stage IIB. The prognosis being that he have a third of his large intestine removed. This was confirmed after a colonoscopy, and it looks like just the surgery is needed at this time.  Ryan’s surgery is scheduled for March 18th. He will be in the hospital for a week, with recovery at home being 6-8 weeks long. While this surgery is covered by Alberta Health Care, and he does qualify for EI during this time, it is not enough to cover all of the day to day living expenses.

I am raising funds for my grandfather ( and pretty much everyone’s grandfather) Steve Jourdain.  Grandpa has had a series of unfortunate events with medical issues.  He currently is unable to walk and has been bed ridden for more than a month with severe pain in his back and hips.   He will most likely undergo spine surgery in the upcoming weeks to hopefully fix his back problems.  This is a pretty series surgery and will require weeks of recovery and therapy.  It doesn’t help that his Dementia has progressed quickly causing hallucinations and confusion.    The funds raised will go to help the medical bills that have been piling up,and continue to pile up, since he is getting the best treatment from Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.  Grandma, Iris Jourdain, is the sole caregiver of grandpa and she cannot work due to his illness.  The money raised will also help them with the cost of traveling over 3 hours to Jacksonville including hotel night stays and food.  Grandpa was always a hard worker and took pride that he worked all his life to provide for his family.  He never denied anyone adopting him as their grandfather or father.

I've spent over a year looking for the woman who left me bleeding at the park begging for help, and after reaching out to all different kinds of authorities, private investigators and lawyers, I've finally come to terms that sometimes justice is not served.  For those of you who don't know, in December 2017, my puppy and I were both attacked by a big german shepherd at a park. Completely unprovoked. The dog sunk his teeth into my arm and pulled my tissue inside out, I'm extremely faint to the sight of blood and was close to passing out, begging the owner of the dog for help in at least calling 911, she shoved me aside, refused to help and ran away. A passerby saw what happened and called 911 for me, but because I had my dog with me they were not able to transport me to the hospital. I was wrapped up and had to walk 8 blocks home in tears, covered in blood, carrying my dog in complete disbelief of what had just happened to me. Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, I felt humiliated and I was in so much pain, not just from the bite but mostly from seeing a human be so dismissive and careless towards another. That is sincerely the most traumatizing part of the whole experience.  Well, since I did not know if the dog was vaccinated, I had to take a bunch of preventive vaccines and treatments, I was out of work for a month, had to do x-rays, and a small surgery in order to remove the tissue that was hanging off my arm. This all added up to a huge medical bill that has been the source of great anxiety and stress for me. After a year and a couple months of searching for the person responsible for this I've finally thrown in the towel and am now trying to figure out how to start paying for this.  Whatever you can do to help me take care of this would make me eternally grateful, if you can't donate, just sharing this along is already a huge help! Thank you all for taking the time to read this and passing it along. love and kisses from Kai (my puppy) and I! -Giulia.",1552118400,70000,6,0,https://images.gofundme.com/rYncBSeoOX7DwFnxK0ee1HqsiMA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/37643206_1552179648265941_r.jpeg,,630,a woman holding a dog in her hands .,nan,

932,https://www.gofundme.com/f/baby-beilfuss-ivf-fund,Baby Beilfuss IVF Fund,"It was not an easy decision to ask you all for help in our journey. We’ve gone back and forth about making this page many times. Vulnerability is intimidating and we are not ones to normally ask for help of any kind. In the end though, our desire to become parents is so much stronger than anything else and outweighs any sort of negativity that could possibly come from this. So here we are, putting ourselves out there. Asking for help and support.  Matthew and I knew, even before we got married almost two and a half years ago, that we wanted nothing more than to start a family of our own and have babies. We were definitely not expecting to have such a difficult time in reaching that dream. After trying to get pregnant on our own for over two years and being unsuccessful, we decided that we needed to seek additional help. We got the initial testing done through my obgyn’s office and then we were referred to The Fertility Center in Grand Rapids earlier this year. We had our new patient visit to talk about everything baby making related and were sent to have more in depth testing done. After looking everything over and considering all the factors, IVF is our only option.  No one ever plans on infertility. We certainly were not. You just never expect it to happen to you. So although we always knew there was a possibility, we are absolutely devastated finding out that this is now our reality. We are hoping to focus all of our positive energy on the emotional and physical stress that comes along with IVF. Any and all positive support that we receive will help allow that to happen.  Unfortunately, our health insurance does not cover anything infertility related, including IVF. All medications, surgeries/procedures, scans, lab work, monitoring, and appointments have and will need to be paid upfront, out of pocket. So after everything is said and done, IVF will cost us anywhere from $12,000-18,000. On top of many other obstacles, money is now a huge barrier in achieving our dream to become parents.  Many of you have asked how you can help after initially sharing that we are going through infertility. This is the best way we can think of besides your continued love and support. Please do not feel obligated to donate by any means. We understand this is our responsibility and will ultimately do whatever needs to be done in order to make this happen. So if you can donate, that would be amazing! We will be extremely grateful with any amount you give. If you’re unable to donate, that’s perfectly okay too! Either way, please consider sharing our story. It may not only help us, but may help others going through similar situations by realizing they are absolutely not alone!  From the bottom of our hearts, thank you! Thank you for taking the time to read our story, and for considering to help and/or support us! Both Matthew and I know in our hearts that we will have our baby when and how we are supposed to. We know that we have many difficulties ahead of us, but are hopeful that we will be given the blessing of a baby at the end of this!

She went through radiation and chemo treatments and she was back to ""normal"" for about 4 months. Mom was hospitalized again this month (March 2019) because of some severe symptoms and now they have found cancer in her stomach and lower spine, as well as blood clots in her legs, which have made her very weak. The doctors at Moffit say they can treat these things for now, but that these may just be band aids as her cancer is aggressive.  This, along with my recent loss of employment, has caused financial strain on our family, and my mother really wants to see her family in Mexico... especially before she gets too ill to travel. So here we are... Mom hasn't seen her family in MX in over a decade and this is her dream right now. Most of us know how important family is  especially when going through a tough time like this. And, since I am her caregiver, I would have to go with her as well for assistance with her meds, walking around, and overall care.  The donations would cover round trip plane tickets for the 2 of us, food, and transportation for about a week or 2. If there is any extra money left over, it would go towards mom's bills, ie medications, car payment, car insurance, etc. Thank you so much to those who have read this somewhat short story of mom's situation.

The home that they raised all five of their children and lived in for over 30 years went up in flames. This is my childhood home. What makes this even worse is that my dad has already had a rough few years. In 2015 he  became an insulin-dependent diabetic. In 2016 he  was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  He has suffered from several accidents as well almost losing his life and almost losing his arm. He has undergone surgeries, treatments, and is on many daily medications.  He is currently on Social Security and disability. Despite all of this, he has maintained somewhat optimistic and at least he is still with us. However, this past weekend was definitely the icing on the cake with losing the home he and my mom worked so hard to maintain over the decades.  My parents were supposed to go on their first vacation in years this week and were so excited to go visit family in Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, their trip has been canceled now as they have to stay local while this mess gets sorted out. My parents did not have much to begin with and now have lost the little that they hung onto. They are wonderful people who will always do what they can for their family. They have even helped out my siblings and I whenever we have fallen on hard times.  For anyone that has grown up with my parents, you have seen their generosity first hand. Whether it was giving someone a place to stay or simply sharing a plate of food. I am now asking all of my contacts to please help give back to my parents the way they have given to others.

I am planning on leaving around mid May and will be leaving Boss with a friend until the transporter can come to pick him up around the last week of May.  I will be home by then and my family and his many friends will be anxiously awaiting his return to continue sharing apples, carrots and sometimes pets! He is much loved in the area. I would be eternally grateful for your help and support in getting him home.

Primero intento cortar sus venas, luego tomo la peor decisión de ingerir pastillas (20 klonopin) y por negligencia médica en el hospital donde se encontraba no hicieron el lavado de estómago que necesitaba, el por poco muere y terminó con daño cerebral permanente e irreparable, postrado en una cama, sufriendo más de lo que sufría. Él encontrarse en esta condición no es vida, mucho menos para el que no deseaba vivir. El mensaje que les quiero llevar es que el suicidio no es la solución al contrario puede ser una cadena perpetua si terminas en una condición así, por favor no cometas el mismo error que cometió mi amigo aún con ayuda y todo lo que sus padres hicieron por él, se encuentra sufriendo y su familia aún más porque aunque le den los mejores cuidados del mundo esto no es calidad de vida para nadie. Si alguien le dice que quiere quitar la vida o demuestra síntomas por favor no lo ignore y bríndele la ayuda necesaria, podrían salvar una vida.  Yo espero en Dios poder con la experiencia que le ha tocado vivir a esta familia y a mí que me he ido integrando a ella poco a poco, ayudar y poder salvar muchas vida es nuestra meta y luego junto a él dar testimonio de vida cuando él se levante de esa cama porque nuestra fe es inquebrantable poder salvar aún muchas más vidas y prevenir que más personas cometan este error. ¡Dios los bendiga!  (Gómez M. Stephanie‎) #PrevenciónDelSuicidio #TodosPorJean On January 28, 2017, my friend had very severe depression in which caused him to make a terrible decision and attempted to end his life.  He first tried to cut his veins, then attempted by taking pills.  At the hospital they did not  pump his stomach as needed.  He nearly died.   The medical malpractice left him with permanent and irreparable brain damage.   Being in this condition is not life, much less for those who do not want to live. The message that I want to bring you is that suicide is not the solution, on the contrary, it can be a life sentence if you end up in such a condition. please do not make the same mistake that my friend made.  Even with help and everything his parents did, he is suffering and his family even more because although they give him the best care in the world this is not quality of life for anyone. If someone tells you that they want to take their life or show symptoms, please do not ignore it and give the necessary help, you could save a life.  I hope to God that  with this experience this family and I have lived, that I would be able to save many lives.  It is our goal that together, with him, give testimony of life when he awakes from that bed because our faith is unshakable to save many more lives and prevent more people from making this mistake.

My name is Ursa Khan.  I'm from Old Bridge, NJ.  I am 28 years old and the first time I was diagnosed was back in July of 2009. During my treatment phase for AML I was on an aggressive Chemotherapy that had me become very septic and was later induced into a coma from August to October. I was fortunate enough to have a stem cell transplant in 2010. I was able to pick up the pieces from my transplant and since then I graduated with Honors for my ASN degree from Middlesex County College on May 2016,  I  graduated in December 2018 with Presidential Honor from Chamberlain University, and I also got my Certification license in February 2019. I was living life as an adult with a respectable prestigious career, unfortunately, life is very unpredictable and I relapsed from a new form of AML leukemia in March 2019.  Because it is a new mutated form the donor's blood was not able to recognize the cell and unluckily for me the cancer took over my donor's blood and once again took over my body. What drew me into the field of nursing were the amazing nurses that took care of me, the nurses who advocated for me and my family. I am lucky to be living as long as I am and even if my outcome is not what we are all hoping for, I am happy with just how much I accomplished in my nine years!

Recently, I visited the emergency room for severe pain in my stomach, although unrelated, the CT Scan and later biopsy revealed I had metastatic cancerous tumors. I was diagnosed with a very rare advanced cancer called GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor). There is limited information to what causes this very rare unknown cancer. Chemotherapy for this type of cancer has also proven to be unsuccessful; immunotherapy and surgery are the only realistic options.  Currently, I have been taking a cancer medication called Gleevec to stop the spread and reduce the size of my GIST in hopes of a successful surgery. This April, I will be having surgery to remove the larger tumors. The surgery itself will be a very intensive procedure with me in the hospital for a week, and an estimated two months time to recover. I will also be on Gleevec for the unforeseeable future, potentially the rest of my life. In addition, I’m having CT Scans every three months and many medical appointments.  As GIST is very uncommon, anyone with any additional information or resources is greatly appreciated.  Although I did not envision a very rare cancer diagnosis called GIST being the next chapter in my life, I have accepted it and I am moving forward with whatever road lays ahead. Please let me remind you to slow down, be grateful, and surround yourself with the people that matter most to you.  Often my friends and family ask, “How are you doing? How do you stay so positive?” To me it’s easy; there are three things I focus on every day that I would like to share:  1. Be your best self. Staying positive is not always easy, but why would you want to be anything else? Life is far too short. You’re the star in your own movie, don’t ever forget to star in it!  2. Be enthusiastic every day. Be excited and you will find people are even more attracted to your energy. If it’s worth doing, why not give everything!  3. Enjoy life every day and never forget to laugh and make someone else laugh. Don’t take things too seriously; no matter what obstacles you face, everyone is faced with challenges in their lives.  Every prayer, every dollar, every gesture is greatly appreciated. All funds will directly go to all medical procedures, appointments, prescription medications, surgeries, biopsies, and CT Scans.

We have been approved to adopt domestically through a private adoption agency and are waiting with great anticipation to be placed with a baby. As many of you know, Emily is unable to have biological children due to a life-long history of Rheumatoid Arthritis and the medications and treatments involved in managing her condition. We have been married for almost 10 years and five years ago we began the adoption journey to start a family. In 2016 the Lord blessed us with our daughter, Lydia Grace, through adoption. It has been such a joy to be parents and to lavish our love on our precious little girl. It has always been the desire of our hearts to have more children and the Lord has given us such a peace and excitement about going through the adoption process again to bring home our second child. We are humbled that the Lord has called us to grow our family through adoption! First and foremost, we are asking for you to join us in prayer as we wait for the Lord to bring us our second child. Pray for the health of the baby as he or she develops in the birth mother’s womb, pray for the birthparents as they have a very difficult, loving and courageous decision to make, and pray for us as we wait with open arms to be chosen by birthparents and to welcome a precious baby into our family. Adoption is an expensive journey. While we are working hard on our end to save money, we want to give others an opportunity to be a part of our adoption story through giving financially. The expense of adopting our next child includes agency fees, home study fees, legal fees, and finances to help the birth mother (maternity care center program). All the money that we are able to raise will go directly towards our adoption fees. We trust that the Lord is going to provide all the necessary measures to accomplish his will in this adoption journey just as we saw first-hand the incredible ways he provided when we adopted Lydia Grace. We cannot thank you enough for taking part in our adoption. Watching the Lord’s plan for our family unfold is truly a humbling experience and we are thankful for your prayers, support, and encouragement! “Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever.

Debbie Harris-Shropshire and Tommy Shropshire are both servant leaders in their community of Weleeka, Oklahoma. Debbie serving as a Pre-K teacher for Weleeka Public Schools for six of her seventeen years in education. Tommy served as a pastor for Calvary Baptist Church in Okemah for the past four years of his amazing thirty eight years as a pastor.  He also worked at Williamson Spradlin Funeral Home. Unfortunately, Tommy has had multiple health set backs including a heart attack and a fall resulting in a broken hip that then multiplied with additional complications.  Debbie also has had a recent fall and ongoing issues with her eyes.  Tommy has just returned home from some extensive physical therapy but needs addition health recovery and support.  These life changes have required Tommy to stop working and pastoring. As you also might guess all of these health situations have taken a toll on both of them physically, emotionally and financially.  Now they have made the difficult decision to move back to Debbie’s family home in Coyle, Oklahoma. These are humble people that are the first to help others and although they haven’t asked for it they need our help.  That is where we (family and friends) come into the picture.   As a group of Debbie’s old college friends gathered recently to reminisce and support each other, it became clear that we could help Debbie and Tommy and hopefully provide a way for others to also participate in this giving endeavor. Our goal is to minimally help with their move at the end of this school year (June/July).   Ideally we would also like to be able to provide some funds to help with some small repairs to the Coyle home, support for unmet medical needs and general transition needs.   Our goal is to raise $5,000 or more. In addition we are hoping to create a caring bridge of people that may assist with other needs. We are asking you to keep them and this endeavor in your prayers.

His diagnosis, which places him on the autism spectrum, makes social and coping skills a daily struggle for him. But he's super bright, loves reading Harry Potter and Calvin and Hobbs. His favorite thing is in the whole world is a character named Skye from Paw Patrol, and he carries his Skye stuffie everywhere with him. Camp Starfish is a wonderful non-profit organization that provides a place for kids like Jordan to tap into their strengths. They provide a 1:1 staff-to-camper ratio at all times to enable success, build social skills, teach coping mechanisms, and help children who have difficulty finding success in traditional settings.  Unfortunately, it costs $4300 to get Jordan into the 2-week summer camp program and he needs $1400 more to be able to afford it. Jordan's mom, Sue, is a strong, selfless loving single mom who has raised Jordan since he was 13 months old. She has worked tirelessly to give Jordan a safe and loving home, and through her work and commitment to address Jordan's special needs, we have all seen Jordan thrive in her care. But it really does take a village to raise a child, and we are asking our 'village' to help Jordan be able to attend Camp Starfish this summer, and give Sue the crucial support that she needs.

He was tragically taken from this world in a fatal car accident. Mike had suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) on halloween night in 2008 during our sophomore year of high school. Traumatic brain injury  is a complex, acute injury with a broad spectrum of severe symptoms and disabilities. The impact on an individual and their family is often devastating, as it was to Mike and the many close ones who cared about him.   Each year an estimated 1.5 million Americans sustain a TBI.  Of that 1.5 million, 50,000 people lose their lives. An estimated 80,000 to 90,000 of those affected are stricken with a long term disability, which can be financially devastating.  An estimated 5.3 million men, women, and children are living with a permanent TBI-related disability in the United States today. With this half marathon fundraiser, we hope to raise money for those affected, along with honoring our fallen friend and teammate by placing the donation in his memory.  We felt a run was especially meaningful because he was a teammate of ours on the Syosset high school track and cross country teams.  It is our goal to embrace the sport that brought us all together in the first place, while also raising money and awareness for TBI research for possible cures and support for the millions of Americans and their families affected.  We plan on using the funds raised to support research and treatment options for those affected with TBI, and we feel there is no better cause than the Kessler Foundation.  The Kessler Foundation is one of the largest TBI treatment and research programs in the US. The foundation strives to provide comprehensive rehabilitation for people with physical disabilities and helps them achieve maximum independence.  In 1985, the Kessler Foundation Research Center was created to promote rehabilitation research and community employment programs and to continue Dr. Henry H. Kessler’s legacy through the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, which he founded in 1947.  The Kessler Foundation facility is currently the largest and most comprehensive hospital for medical rehabilitation in New Jersey. Your support would be greatly appreciated by all of us who were lucky enough to know Mike.

I’m Teddy and I just arrived at Georgia Jack Russell Rescue … Well, technically, I didn’t quite make it to the rescue ranch. Instead, I went straight to the vet. You see, I was recently diagnosed with interverbral disc disease and lost the ability to walk on my hind legs. My tail still wagged just fine, though! Unfortunately, spine surgery is incredibly expensive and also requires a lot of TLC for me afterwards. My family was unable to help me with this for several reasons, so they went in search of a new home or rescue for me who could help me and posted my story online. Lots of people saw my sad post and were naturally concerned. Why wouldn’t they be? I’m young, adorable, and full of life. I want to run and play like any young Terrier. They reached out to GA JRT, who have been known to take in lots of crippled fellas like me in and help many of them get back to full mobility, mostly recently with some guy named  . They saw my story and photo and that was “all she wrote.” Some people named “  ” picked me up near Savannah on Tuesday for a fun car ride … but I ended up at the vet(?!). Wait, what?!   isn’t fun! It had been awhile since I had “done my business” and it was obvious I was in pain, so they weren’t going to waste any time. And I’m a sweet boy. I just like to be around people, even when they are feeling me in places that hurt and putting me through some machine to find out exactly what was going on (the muzzle was “just in case”). Of course, they were hydrating and giving me “goofy juice” to make me feel better, so that made it easier, too. They decided that I had a ruptured disc and needed surgery ASAP, so under I went on Wednesday. And here it is, Thursday morning. I’m wrapped up, snug as a bug, and sleeping. Dr. Wright found much more damage than expected during my surgery. He did everything he needed to do to ""fix me up,"" but there was some bleeding in my spinal cord and bruising that causing some concern. For now, it will be a waiting game to see how I heal.  If you would like to contribute anything to my surgery and recovery, we would sure appreciate it. I know I have a long road ahead of me, but hope to share my success story like Sawyer did. Thank you for all of your support! As always, we will keep you posted here and on our    with my progress. Leaving home and headed to the ranch. In pain, but still such a happy boy!

It is a cancer glioma. I have had it removed but unfortunately it has grown back, my doctor wants me to go in stronger chemo but I have opted out. I want to go the natural path I have studied and researched that more people survive longer down this path. I can no longer work because my left side is numb and I walk with a stick, I can’t run anymore or do my much loved boxing. My new path is using CBD oil as it is helping with the pain. The problem is it costs a lot of money and I want to live more than 12 months and with the oil I have a better chance for 2 years.  With your help help I can be with my three beautiful boys and partner Jeff.

Austin came down on top of the other rider.  Both riders were airlifted to University of Cincinnati Hospital.  There are multiple health areas of concern.  He has 4 bleeds on the brain in which the initial scan showed two were stable and two were expanding, broken ribs, collapsed lung and now pneumonia.  He has been on a ventilator and heavily sedated since the accident.  During neuro tests he is squeezing hands with both left and right side, moving his head and wiggling his right toes.  He has not responded to moving his left leg/toes and he has not been able to open his eyes.  Doctors have done procedures to drain fluid off the lung and currently the bleed is stable.  It is unknown at this time what the extent of his brain injury. Doctors have also commented he could be there for 6 months.  This creates a major financial burden for Austin and his family being out of work for that long.  He is a recent graduate of Marshall University with a Masters Degree in Biological Sciences and he is now employed at Marshall working in their department of biological sciences handling their water quality, environmental engineering, freshwater ecology, water quality monitoring, water quality assessment, eutrophication and algae.  He recently purchased a new home in 2018 with his fiancé and stepdaughter.  This leaves his fiancé with the financial responsibility while he is on the long road to recovery.  She has been staying with him at the hospital and taking vacation time from work currently.  When he is released he will more than likely require extensive care and monitoring.  At this time it is unknown to the extent of his brain injury and when/if he will be able to return to work.",1547107200,10000,2,0,https://images.gofundme.com/O9s9rx_CgfJPuNg4iYR6vHkf09Q=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/36082786_1547127842117162_r.jpeg,,5640,a man standing in front of a wall holding a skateboard .,nan,

He fought a hard fight, but his body was just so tired. He had been sick about a week, but had no insurance. We went into the hospital on 01.08.2019 he didn’t feel good and was having trouble breathing. They told my momma, he had double pneumonia and were admitting him so we all thought everything was fine. Later on that night, she called saying he had coded, and it took them 5 minutes to bring my daddy back. So, my sister came and we rushed over there and ran back to see him. They had him hooked to a ventilator. And also, about 10 different machines. The whole family was there to see him, be with him, pray for him. Later that day, 01.09.2019 we found out the pneumonia had turned septic, and run the infection through his blood stream. They had him on the maximum of medications to fight this infection. And also the maximum of oxygen as even with the ventilator he was having a hard time getting enough. My daddy could hear us. He reacted to us talking and touching his hands. I thought he was going to pull through this. He’s always been so strong. Then they called us all in and told us he had a heart attack. They told us he had very little chance of waking back up. So we all were with daddy. We had to visit one by one because of course momma couldn’t leave his side. (Only two to a room at a time) lastnight I was going to stay in the lobby/waiting area. I went and seen daddy. His vitals were more normal. His swelling had come down. And his color had come back. And I felt like he had a fighting chance. They had asked everybody to go home from the lobby. And since he was stable I did come home. Not even an hour of sleep, and he had coded twice. We rushed as fast as we could to be there for him, for my mom. When I walked in, I could see them doing cpr. They done that for 45 minutes trying to bring him back. And he was still flatlining. As soon as I ran back, they called it. Our family is still in utter shock. My daddy had just turned 41 years old December 19th. This all happened within this two day period. I had talked to him before and he was fine. And video called a couple days before and he looked good. As you know, a lot of times being that young there are no plans in place. And my daddy had no kind of insurance what so ever. He deserves to have a proper funeral. If any body can, please please. It doesn’t matter how much, every little bit helps. Please donate to help us be able to lay him to rest. If you can’t donate, please share. And please pray for the rest of my family. He was a son, brother, husband, father, a grandfather to three beautiful grandchildren. He was so much to everybody. He always knew how to make everybody happy. I truly do not know how I will be able to move on from this. My daddy was too young. Thank you to any body who can contribute by donating, sharing, and or praying.

Melanie was a young mother with a Beautiful 6 year old little girl. She was an absolutely Amazing mother to say the least. Her daughter was a miracle child that doctors told her could never happen. Melanie was told by numerous doctors as a young adolescent that she would never be able to conceive nor carry a child. After years of trying to conceive, it actually happened. The downfall to the story is the father was very condescending, controlling, and verbally abusive.  Melanie decided to leave him when her daughter was just over a year old. When they split up, he told her if she didnt get back with him that he would do everything in his power to take her daughter away.  We all told Melanie not to worry about losing her daughter because she has done nothing wrong. Fast forward to yesterday morning,  , he was able to get full custody of this little girl and Melanie could only see her with supervised visits. She was told she would have to hire an outside supervisor for the visits costing $50 per hour to see her child.  I testified on her behalf at a custody hearing, and the judge literally would not listen to anything I had to say.  She would not listen to anyone that talked on Melanie's behalf at all. This is pure evil that went down and Melanie was right all along, his money will win in the courts. I set the amount of $8,000 to cover a very basic funeral. I am hoping for way more. The money over funeral costs will be used for future litigation to get visitation to Melanie's Mom, Sister, and Brother.

Every morning I purchase coffee from Dunkin Donuts and todays purchase was different. ☕️ This worker is what every employee wants, a friendly personality, amazing customer service and builds connections with each person that walks through the door. She knows almost everyone’s order and always finds a way to pick up from the conversation that was held yesterday. She truly cares about her job and making every interaction a pleasant one by listening to her customers. Today was different for me. Today the roles were switched when she explained something to me which had me listening. I used my Dunkin app to purchase my order and was short 50 cents. So without thinking, I just pulled out my debit card and inserted it to complete the payment. She asked me, “You don’t do change?”. I laughed and said “I am bad with change. I prefer just using my card.” Then, she proceeded to tell me something that I couldn’t help but think about my entire car ride to work.  She explained how change adds up. She explained her tips are divided every two weeks to her seven children for doing chores. She said each child gets $2 for completing a chore and there is a chore list hanging up. She also explained how they are saving for a house. She would like to teach her children what it means to save for something you want. She also said there have been times where her children have found change on the ground and would pick it up and put it in their change jar proudly. I feel we all have a change jar or a designated area to throw our change. But to her, change was to help support her family and eventually help buy a house. So besides her working many hours and various hours at Dunkin Donuts, she is still teaching her seven children that hard work may take time, but eventually it will pay off. I’ve always heard the expression, ‘Every little penny counts’, but today I actually understood what that meant. I would like to help this woman, even if it is for a few dollars donated by each person who reads this.  Please share this story.
