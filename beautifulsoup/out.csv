https://www.gofundme.com/f/japanese-garden-renovation,Japanese Garden at Monte Sano,"A quick history: The North Alabama Japanese Garden was started in 1988 in the Monte Sano State Park as just a hobby garden and something to enjoy doing with my children. Maybe a couple hundred square feet next to a swamp or bog in a place the park gave me to plant and improve an area not traveled by many.In 1991, we built a Tea House to give it some Japanese character and started an annual spring festival in 1992. This continued for about 15 years and then the garden and Tea House started falling into disrepair. I fell into disrepair also with cancer and had to take a break from work involving any physical labor.Now we are rebuilding the bridges, the Tea House, and all other structures, improving some of the garden with Japanese Maples and a raked stone garden. We have a team of volunteers working hard to make the Japanese garden beautiful again. We also are working very hard to preserve the natural beauty of the mountain top area, and the native plants and azaleas in this area. We have formed a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization so that we can get sponsors and donations to help us make it new and safe A.D.A. compliant.The donations will help in paying for the materials used to rebuild the Japanese garden, as well as cost for the continuous repairs and maintenance to make the garden beautiful and maintain the condition for generations to come.Thank you,Robert Black",https://images.gofundme.com/zt2u367XT9e6tV20QOdTnLJz3Vk=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17144028_1483386913.8518.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Robert  Black is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Japanese Garden Our Town Charity Foundation.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$2,705 raised of $30,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/copstopguardian,Cop Stop Guardian Traffic Stop App,"Cop Stop Guardian... Curing ""Police-Itis"" One Stop At A Time!    Join The Cop Stop Guardian Movement!In America, there are over a thousand violent to deadly police encounters with American citizens every year. These encounters wreak havoc on the lives of all the people involved and create an air of fear and distrust between citizens and law enforcement, thereby widening the gap of communication and pathways to a better solution. Well, we at Cop Stop Guardian™  feel that we have found a way to close that gap and bring about a practical, beneficial and pro-active solution. We all know that Everyone wants to get home safely from any police stop,  citizens AND officers alike, and some of the main obstacles preventing this from happening are...1. A fear of bodily injury from the Citizen by the officer and vice-versa.2. An ignorance of one’s own civil rights and proper pull over procedure.3. Lack of education and awareness of local laws that govern basic police stops 4. Improper training on behalf of law enforcement on how to lessen tensions without lethal violence.5. A few bad police officers who do not have the Citizen's best interest or preservation of rights in mind or at heart.So Cop Stop Guardian's Passion and Mission is to Serve as a pathway of communication between law enforcement and citizens during traffic stops until citizens, and police officers, gain the confidence and education to create a permanent relationship of trust, understanding, respect and eventually community between the two. How do we plan to do this you ask? With the Cop Stop Guardian SmartPhone App!You will be able to use The Cop Stop Guardian App to help you communicate effectively with law enforcement officers at traffic stops so that you may get home Safely, without physical injury or incident.App Features:When the App is activated, your camera is turned on and immediately begins recording the police stop. The Cop Stop Call Center is immediately notified and the App user's phone mic is automatically turned onto speaker mode. The call center operator will notify the officer that the traffic stop is being monitored by a third party video and audio recording service for the safety of both the driver and the officer(s).The Cop Stop Operator will ask the officer(s) for their name(s) and badge number(s) to submit for verification as well to file charges in case of any misconduct, while simultaneously sending out a #Cop Stop Flash Mob distress signal to other App users within a half a mile radius to Mob the traffic stop for Community support and extra video documentation. An Alert Notification will also be sent to App users nationwide regarding the traffic stop.The App will also contain...•All personal information relevant to traffic stop, I.e.… Drivers license information, if the driver is licensed to carry a firearm (if applicable as some states have open carry laws), Any sensitive medical condition(s) such as being hearing impaired, Foreign languages spoken etc..•Video Clips (as well as a virtual ""Legal Library"") teaching users Basic traffic and civil rights law as well as correct ""pull over"" procedures, which will include proper demeanor, rapport and articulation with law enforcement.•Online public forums to connect and encourage users across the country to establish law study and legislative activity groups. •It will contain links to facilitate connections between citizens and local law enforcement for a productive interaction on how to ease tensions and create trusting relationships within communities across America.•Trauma support groups for victims of police brutality and those injured during police traffic stops.AND SO MUCH MORE!!! Our goal and shared perspective is set on communication, Safety, community awareness and the combining of simple, proactive steps that can assist in building a new platform of trust between citizens and Law enforcement. That is why we have started our Cop Stop Community Watch Project Campaign.  WE NEED YOUR HELP to make this vision a reality! It's only through the support of one another that we will overcome these stressful and perilous times that plagued our country. With the creation and implementation of the Cop Stop Guardian App we can better service our Communities and help any and all who need assistance in their travels and experiences when dealing with law enforcement.Our Service to the Community is :Creating a safe third-party communication and accountability system for police stops in America.Empowering and bringing together Citizens and Law enforcement,  for a better understanding of how to alleviate the violence and tension that is prevalent today between these two communities. Educating all communities on local laws that govern traffic stops and laws that Secure their inalienable and unalienable Rights.Educating the public on proper demeanor, rapport and protocol required during a traffic stop.Ensuring law abiding officers are not falsely accused and unjustly persecuted .Creating a pro-active approach to the prevention and eventual eradication of  the many violent and deadly traffic stops that occur among Americans today. Creating a neutral, third-party national database on abusive and corrupt members of law enforcement who misuse their Authority.Reinvigorating a sense Justice among the People who fear unjust violence by corrupt police officers.DONATE AND HELP US MAKE THIS A REALITY!!!!",https://images.gofundme.com/_qMdxnoRJK_Iy83rS6IwXM71KW0=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tcnwJseei_Y/0.jpg,[],0,"Created January 18, 2017",Kevin Barringer is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Kevin Barringer.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$4,093 raised of $75,000 goal"

He was flown to a hospital in San Antonio, Texas due to a major head trauma resulting from the crash. As many of us gathered and prayed hoping God would grant Raul a second chance, we never realized that God had a greater plan for him. Raul entered the Kingdom of God on January 2, 2017 at 3:14 am, and he said see you soon to his family and friends. Raul, in the middle of his senior year in high school, was a boy filled with spirit, happiness, and love. He always kept a smile on his face, and brought even bigger smiles to the people around him. Everyone who knew him would agree when they say that his light-hearted spirit had a way of touching people’s hearts, and that is one thing that will always be remembered about him. In a way, Raul helped us all. As we say our final goodbyes to Raul, I ask of those who loved him and those who did not have the privilege of meeting him to lend a helping hand to his family with anything at all to help towards the funeral cost. Anything would be a great help in helping his family and our community commemorate the memory of a boy who brought a little more joy into our lives on and off the football field.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-fight-npc-and-take-a-trip,Help Tim Fight NPC,"Tim’s StoryMy brother, Tim, is fighting Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC). NPC is a very rare and terminal genetic disease that affects Tim’s ability to metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within a cell. Excessive amounts of lipids accumulate in the brain and cause cells to shutdown, therefore affecting Tim’s cognitive and motor abilities. There are only an estimated 500 cases of this disease worldwide and about 100 in the US. NPC is always fatal. Tim began to show symptoms years ago, but due to his Asperger’s Syndrome and the rareness of the disease it was difficult for doctors to diagnose him. The diseases has drastically progressed since I started this page. What started as clumsiness has developed into inability to walk on his own. The disease also affects his processing abilities. Tim tested in the second percentile for processing – meaning his ability to receive information, understand it and respond to it has extremely declined. This continues to decline. NPC has also caused Tim to have hearing loss requiring hearing aids. Every two weeks my family takes Tim to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago where he gets a spinal infusion of a trial drug, cyclodextrin. Tim has done this over 70 times. While the disease continues to progress, there's no knowing how much worse it could be without the infusions.When I first started this page, my brother was in the ICU fighting pneumonia and pleural effusion with serious complications that required surgery. He's heading back to the hospital for another surgery, but this time on his legs and feet. The goal is to make Tim's legs braceable so he can walk withe aids. I'm going to write a separate update with the details on this. *Please note with the progression of the disease it's difficult to keep this story up to date. GoFundMe automatically lands visitors on this page, please check my updates for the most recent developments in Tim's fight against NPC.How You Can HelpDonations will help cover the cost of the never ending medical bills (this latest hospital stay is sure to be costly), updates to my family's home to make it easier for Tim to get around (just installed a stairlift) and general cost of living as we’ve come to grips that Tim will never work again.Thank YouFirst, I want to thank you for visiting this page.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-eastons-medical-bills,Help with Easton's Medical Bills,"Hello.  My name is Cindy Erlandson, proud mother to Devin Constant, mother-in-law to Tyler Constant and grandmother to Easton Tyler Constant.  Easton was born on December 22, 2016 and shares his birthday with his proud father Tyler.  He was born at a healthy weight of 8lbs 7ozs and was sent home from the hospital within the normal 2 day timeframe.  Devin and Tyler were overjoyed that they were able to bring home a beautiful, healthy, good natured little boy.  When he was 5 days old, Easton had his first check up.  The doctor said he was perfect.    Two days later, things changed suddenly.Here is what happened in Devin's words:Thursday morning our little man came down with a high temp and wasn't acting like himself. We brought him to the ER to be checked out, all while thinking this was going to be an expensive trip to just be told he had a cold. When we got there he had a series of tests done and his temp kept climbing and wouldn't come down with Tylenol. I could tell he was getting worse and he stopped eating. Easton and I were air lifted to Sanford in Sioux Falls, when we landed his temp was at ...104°. After more tests were done it was confirmed he has bacterial meningitis. That day was the hardest day of both of our lives. Friday, Easton was doing much better and we have realized he is such a fighter! His temp was going down and he is starting to eat again. Our doctor expects him to make a full recovery but he will remain in the NICU for at least the next 3 weeks for antibiotic therapy. We are so blessed to have caught this early and that he will be okay. Please keep our little family in your prayers!Easton is feeling better each day, and thankfully, his parents are are no longer consumed with fear of losing him.  He is responding well to treatments and is expected to go back home in about 3 weeks if all goes well.  There are possibilities of hearing loss and developmental and speech delays or disabilities as side effects of the medications and meningitis, so please continue to pray for him.Devin and Tyler were financially prepared for the birth of their first child.  They were not prepared for the air lift and 3 plus weeks of hospital stay and treatment.  Because the treatment is taking place in 2 separate years, it increases their out of pocket expenses.  After checking with the insurance company, they estimated out of pocket costs to be around $10,000.  I believe that with various family members support, we can help them cover about half of the costs. My hope is that Devin and Tyler would have another chance at joyously bringing their new baby home.  After this scare, these new parents may be more worried than most about their baby's health.  But, other than that, I hope their biggest concerns will be lack of sleep and whose turn is it the change the diaper, rather than having to worry about a new financial obligation and how to pay for it.I am thankful to all who have prayed for Easton's health, there were a couple of miracles that happened that led to him getting the prompt and correct treatment that led to his recovery.  We feel truly blessed.",https://images.gofundme.com/v9YxMx1QNYQlrT0UGpSLOd5b9Rw=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_fb_1483389274.3621_funds.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_1483390669.8479_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_1483390623.338_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_1483394108.0292_funddescription.jpg']",3,"Created January 2, 2017",Cindy Matzdorff Erlandson is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Devin Constant.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,720 raised of $5,000 goal"

Doctors believe the cancer is exclusive to his brain.Following his release from the hospital, he will be moved to St. Lukes rehab facility in Spokane for a few weeks, and the process after that will be radiation and chemotherapy.  The path will be long and difficult, and expensive, which is why we are posting this GoFundMe account.  He does have Medical coverage, but there are expenses that will not be covered; there will be hotel and travel expenses for Haley, as well as some lost wages, that she will need help with as well.  Those that know Bill, know that he is proud and if he could stop this, he would, but sometimes a helping hand is what is needed.  If you do not feel comfortable donating through this process, but you'd like to help, there is an account set up at Coulee Dam Federal Credit Union.  The account is set up under Darleen Fitzhugh S2 - the S2 designates it is for Bill Galbraith Donations.  You can go to any one of the branches and make a deposit, or if you want to write a check, you can make it out to Darleen Fitzhugh, with Bill's name in the memo line.  Mail your check to:  CDFCU, PO Box  216, Coulee Dam, WA 99116.  With all our hearts, we thank you for any and all donations.",https://images.gofundme.com/Q2w7hEnLjhGpAFc6gzQdihNWm0g=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145170_1483389806.5472.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Tammy Fitzhugh Spicer is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Haley Galbraith.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$4,570 raised of $5,000 goal"

It's quite frustrating to go back and forth with medical professionals and receive no answers as to why the problem is happening. So being able to communicate to you all through social media has been a lifesaver for keeping my spirits up and distracted from the pain I'm in.Long story short I have an infection in my scrotum that requires serious antibiotics and complete bed rest for about a week and a half. Also basically a scrotum bra to keep my testicles from hanging low and increasing the risk of spreading the infection. Glamorous right? All caused from a probable UTI and (get this) wearing cock rings too small for long periods of time. On top of that my kidneys are in bad shape. My use of steroids combined with prep and not drinking enough water have basically forced my kidneys to make an SOS call. This of course, could've been prevented had I been smarter and taken better care of myself. I take full responsibility for that and it has been quite the wake up call.In September I was diagnosed with non hotchkins lymphoma type A. I've kept it kind of a secret because A. I don't want pity and B. It sounds worse than it is. Yes I have a type of cancer but it has about a 90% survival rate if caught and treated quickly. Thankfully it was caught before any real dyer concerns could happen. So please don't think I'm dying or anything of the sort. It will take much more than that to get rid of me. Unfortunately I haven't been being the most responsible when it comes to dealing with the news regardless of how mild the doctors tell me it is. When you're 29 and you hear you have cancer of ANY kind it does feel a bit hopeless and I've slipped into depression and made not so great decisions to numb or forget the possibilities of the worse case scenario. Even though Ive always been a step behind my entire life, I feel I'm ahead of the game this time and choose to start dealing with it head on instead of ignoring it so that I dont make it worse and epidsodes like this week are no more common as a scene without me moaning. All that being said, I'm very lucky to have a few friends in the medical profession who have given me care under the table but after this episode it is clear that I have to get serious about getting this issue under control so that I can continue on having a normal life. I have medical which is basically poor people's insurance but I've been advised by my doctor and by the beautiful bills I've received, even for the minor treatments I've gotten that it basically covers nothing for a condition of this sort. So I'm changing my healthcare plan to one that will cover my condition and the regular treatments required for the months to come so that I can come out of it healthy and not in debtAll insurances have a deductible that must be paid before the policy will cover any treatment. I have chosen a pricier plan when it comes to that but hoping that after the deductible is taken care of my medication and anything required to send this cancer packing will be of no cost to me. So after the deductible and the price rate of the medications I've just recieved I'm hoping to raise about $10,000 so that I can go these next 6months with the best possible care and not have to stress about being able to afford it. Any donation would be greatly appreciated no matter how small. We all need help sometimes and I'm no longer too proud to admit this is a time I do myself. If I'm able to raise more than the funds I need I will donate the remainder to a charity involving homeless gay youth. We as community and an industry need to take care of each other and make the year 2017 the year we finally put petty shit aside and stick up for one another and have each other's backs!I love you all very much and I thank you for being you and keeping the best medicine alive.Humor and laughter I'm not going anywhere and will continue to work as much as I can. I'm just asking for help to keep me able to do so.All my love to you all",https://images.gofundme.com/ATq-efBqroROXlgSwMZyE0u4U_o=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145254_1483389502.0445.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Micah Brandt is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,745 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/sunusracing,Stillbirth Awareness Campaign,"During the summer of 2017, SUNUS Ocean Racing with its crew; TV personality and seasoned adventurer Ben Fogle & record holding powerboat racer Tom Montgomery-Swan will attempt to break the world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the British Isles by sea in a small 32ft long racing boat. Both men have suffered the loss of a child, born still at full term and both along with 20 other team members want their event to be a national platform, raising awareness for this often not spoken about tragedy. Many suffer in silence and the team want to break the mold and in a small way offer support to effected families across the country. Many hospitals across the UK are not equipped to offer real support and care for Stillbirth pregnancies. Much of the equipment created to aid post birth care are not funded by the already stretched National Health Service. Through our activities we would like to do what we can to see more hospitals equipped with vital technology to help those having to go through such an ordeal. From our own personal experiences there are many practical things that can be done to help provide hospitals with better equipment and support products. In the UK babies are born still 15 times a day, often the fantastic charities that provide support are investing million's in vital research to stop stillbirth for good, however we feel we can have an instant, reactionary impact with support equipment that can have a positive impact on families NOW rather than in years to come. Many mum's have to give birth to their still babies on wards full of healthy pregnancies, rather than in their own dedicated rooms, where in privacy they can be given the time to mourn and receive the support they desperately need. Many are left feeling alone, as if they let their children down, that this is more unique than they realise. We plan to use our national events and marine motorsport to help break the silence on this taboo subject, offering a voice for these individuals and point affected ones to the charities experienced in providing care, outside of the support equipment we would like to fund with your help. The Event:This 2000 mile epic challenge will truly test the team as they battle some of the worlds toughest seas and the UK's remotest coastlines, non stop to break the current record of 73 hours. This will challenge the crew to power through no sleep or rest while at the wheel of their record breaking boat, equivalent to 3 Les Mans 24hr car races back-to-back. The team will need to be at the peak of their physical and mental abilities as they master night navigation and sea survival skills as they skipper their vessel around our beautiful but sometimes unforgiving coastline. The route will include mainland Britain, Ireland and remote islands, a total distance of just over 2000 miles, with a goal record time of 50 hours. With an experienced media team behind them, It is planned that as the team travel around the UK, the record attempt will attract national and local press, further promoting our cause and awareness program.The boat represents the very latest in marine design, using the most fuel efficient and emission friendly performance engines. The boat too incorporates the well proven racing hull which lowers fuel consumption by effective hydrodynamic design. We will also be using the trip to work on our green technology development, testing natural fibre composites from Flax fibres, rather than traditional non eco-friendly synthetic carbon fibres. The teams events throughout the 2017 season along with this circumnavigation world record are funded separately by the team's commercial partners who have supported the awareness program. The funds raised within this campaign will go to fund our Stillbirth Awareness Campaign. The team has already used 2016 to create awareness for Stillbirth. During this time the boat was featured on Amazon Prime's hit TV show; The Grand Tour. The boat was on show at the UK's largest boat show, on show to over 200,000 people. During the normal racing events of the team, the boat won 2 out of 3 events and broke two national speed records, attracting over 40,000 visitors a week to the teams website and social platforms. More visitors than any other UK racing team, superb news for our awareness campaign. Our plan is only to build upon this foundation for 2017 and reach more people with our awareness program.How the funds raised within this campaign will be spent.The more our campaign is supported, the more we can do for effected families, although you may not be able to join us on the boat, even if it be a pound, every penny helps and can change a horrific situation for a family near you. SUNUS Ocean Racing have worked with partners to organise various items for Stillbirth support. From working with Midwives to equip stillbirth delivery rooms to securing trade deals on equipment, making donations go further. Specifically funds raised will go towards purchasing vital cooling Moses baskets, technology which means parents do not have to send their newborn baby to the mortuary, it allows you time to digest what has happened, get to know your child and invite loved ones to visit you. These are presented in very normal nursery style baskets and are less raw then traditional stainless medical trolleys, taking your baby away to the mortuary. SOR Baby Boxes are presented in quality boxes that can be kept as a memory box. Containing items you might not think off unless you have been through stillbirth and often do not have available when rushed into a hospital situation. These contain premature neutral clothing, a small digital camera as the NHS only provide medical style photos, some would like to have family photos to treasure. Other items include hand and feet casting kits, keepsake teddy's, information on support charities and networks, parenthood bracelet (for mother and baby) and a swaddle blanket. With funding, these boxes will be distributed to labour wards by mothers who have had stillbirth pregnancies and understand the trauma. If funding amounts allow, it is the SOR team goal to use our activities to complete a stillbirth recovery room, decorated and finished for medical delivery of a baby however in a softer ""non-medical"" environment with the privacy parents deserve. Many hospitals do not have this facility, with your help this can be changed. Remaining funds will be used on various stillbirth awareness events and activities. Donors will be kept up to date on the teams activities, allowing you to feel really part of the team. We thank you for your support and hope you can join our journey to making a change for good, through a national event which pushes us harder than ever before.See the boat at this years London Boat Show (6th-15th January) where we will be promoting the boats activities and stillbirth awareness program.",https://images.gofundme.com/GkVwgCvWhWo8khLf4TyBCWuMt3Q=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145306_1483390376.8764.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Tom Montgomery-Swan is organizing this fundraiser.,"Sports, Teams & Clubs","£5,145 raised of £20,000 goal"

He has provided the opportunity for me to be a part of a youth mission team going to Nicaragua. I’ll be traveling with others from Grace United Methodist Church in Cape Coral, FL, leaving on May 27th and returning on June 3rd. Our team will spend a week serving a community in Esteli, Nicaragua. We will share the Gospel of Jesus with children, youth, and young adults, through our words and deeds. I have been a member of Grace United Methodist Church over the past 9 years and I have felt the calling of ministry this past year. I have been meeting and mentoring with our youth pastors to discuss the calling my heart has felt from the Lord. I truly find joy in serving others. I have actively served at many events over the years such as, Grace Place kids, Celebrate Recovery kids, Respite, Vacation Bible School, Shoes of Hope, and J. Colin English School family outreach. I have never been on a mission trip and I feel as though this will be the next step forward in the growth of my ever-strengthening faith in God.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/togo-africa-midwifery-intensive,"Togo, Africa Midwifery Intensive","DELIVER MORE THAN JUST THE GOOD NEWS...IN TOGO, AFRICA      APRIL 20 - JUNE 5, 2017A few years ago, on a mission trip to Ghana, Africa, two women in the village gave birth during the night alone in their huts. The next morning, I was amazed to see both of them at the well at separate times, with their newborns, bending and lifting in order to fill the large containers on top of their heads. My naïve awe of their strength quickly turned into shock and heartbreak when, in discussion with my local friend, I found out that the maternal mortality rate in that part of the country is 50%! It seemed beyond comprehension that in such a joyous occasion, rather than the choices of an ‘ideal’ birth plan, these women were dealing with life and death and only 1 of every 2 would survive. There had to be a better model of care and education that would drastically improve this statistic that could include attention to well-woman, maternity, postpartum support, and infant care all while honoring their cultural distinctions. Knowing that Ghana was likely not unique in this awful statistic, I began crying out to the Lord from the depths of my heart that day. Hoping for a solution to the problem, I felt a clear tug on my heart to become part of the birth story for many, no matter what that might mean for me personally. It was certainly not the solution that I was looking for and since have often wished that there were a different one. However, the cry of my heart persists as does my desire to draw near to those that deserve better. That day still remains so poignant to me and drives me forth as the moment that led me to and keeps me focused on the path of midwifery.

Upon my return, he was quick to share this with me. Given what I just told you, you can probably imagine all of the things going through my heart and mind! Not surprisingly, here we are pursuing an offer that I received to be a part of critical clinical experience in Togo, Africa. This is the same birth center that God worked out for me to visit just days before I left for our trip. The offer is to travel to Togo from April 20 -June 5, 2017 as a family so that I can be 1 of 6 incredibly blessed students who will get intimate hands-on training in a birth center. Beautiful Mom and babe in Kenya, AfricaThe next few months will be spent buying tickets, getting visas, making arrangements on the Togo YWAM base to set up our temporary residence, planning to have help at the farm while we’re away, and, most importantly, staying alert to Abba’s voice. This opportunity in Togo makes our dream, about helping to launch a birth center in Kenya, seem possible and within reach now. What a difference a little time makes while we wait on the Lord to take care of all of the details.

It has effected not only his heart, but his shoulder and all the way down to his fingers. Because of his condition,  his left arm was three times the size of his right arm.  The swelling and pain became so intense, that Doctors decided to amputate his left arm. From the first surgery until the amputation at Christmas 2016, it has been an enormous financial burden on his family.   Because he still has fistulas in his left shoulder, the type of prosthetis will need to be unique to meet his needs.Doctors predict that most all of the swelling of the surgery will be gone by the end ofMarch 2017, and he can get ""fitted"" for a prosthetic arm.  His family is  in desperate financial need to help Bill get his new arm so that he has the ability to continue working to provide for his family.   He and his family wish to thank you so much for your compassion, prayers and donations.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/masons-heart-fund,Mason's Heart Fund,"Hi everyone, this is my amazing grandson Mason Hirschfield and he is the son of my son Chris and his wife Brittany. Mason was born with a Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) which was recently discovered. He was diagnosed with a Partial Atrioventricular Canal Defect (AVCD/AVSD), which means he has a large Primum Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) and a cleft mitral valve. Essentially that is a large hole between the top chambers of his heart and his mitral valve didn’t form completely. We are so blessed that his new pediatrician heard his murmur and referred him to Sibley Heart Center Cardiology where Dr. Harden diagnosed the defect. In January 2017 he will have open heart surgery to repair the defects in his little heart. His surgeon will put a patch over the hole and stitch his valve. This will allow his oxygen rich blood to go out to his body where it belongs instead of flowing back in his heart. He will be at CHOA Egleston in Atlanta, GA for about a week after surgery until he gets strong enough to go home. I would also like to tell everyone a little about CHDs. CHDs effect nearly 1% of all births per year in the US. About every 15 minutes another baby is born with a CHD. AVSDs are just one kind and are only about 5% of all CHDs. In 2005, for a privately insured population in the Unites States, the estimated medical care costs for an average infant with any CHD was about $23,000, and costs were higher for infants with a severe CHD (this is a statistic from 2005 prior to the skyrocketing medical costs that our country has experienced in the past decade). We're asking for help in two ways:-PRAY for steady hands for the surgeon and a successful surgery for Mason's heart. -PRAY for Mason to be strong and pray for his family to be courageous. If anyone would like to donate to a fund it would help his parents pay for some of the medical bills and expenses incurred to mend his heart back to a healthy heart. Nothing is too big or too small and your prayers are deeply appreciated!

We have seen the image of the little girl holding her hands up to the photographer because she thought he was holding a gun... This is due to the normality of the situation in Syria. We have all seen the young boy sitting in the ambulance in a state of shock covered in rubble... Yet we don’t realise the impact this is having on those children mentally.    I recently attended a conference where Muntada Aid had made an appeal. They discussed the psychological damage to the people of Syria specifically the children. Children often draw images depicting things they have seen. They are becoming desensitised to violence because of what they have seen so frequently. 3-year old children should be drawing images of nature, their family playing and happy times... But a 3-year old in Syria draws bombs dropping on houses, bullets striking civilians... HOW IS THIS NORMAL?  The most common cause of death amongst soldiers is actually soldiers who suffer with PTSD committing suicide due to the trauma of war, so imagine how the children of Syria are feeling.   Imagine a 5-year old girl witnessing her mother raped and her father brutally murdered, - only a few examples of the atrocities occurring in Syria. These unfortunate events are leaving the children of Syria with deep psychological scars.  We can only hope that one day Syria will be a beautiful nation again, but how can Syria rebuild itself when these children who will one day lead Syria are so disturbed by the violence they have witnessed over the years?  Our leaders have failed to protect these children from the realities of war, but we have an opportunity to give them a better future. It is never too late help those innocent souls.   The money that I raise will be going to Muntada Aid, to enable them to give the people of Syria the psychological help that they so desperately need.  My brothers & sisters we are all aware that giving in charity is a pillar of Islam. It is part of obedience and worship to Allah. The Prophet PBUH said when engaging in war we are not to harm the children. It would be wrong for us to turn away from them, as we have a duty to do our best to ensure that we do the best we can to help them in whatever manner we can.  The Prophet PBUH said “The believers shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity” – Al-Tirmidhi Hadith 604  Thank you for taking the time to read this, May Allah bless you always.",https://images.gofundme.com/QWUbBIFd9jmqWsjarzXDRudoJmM=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NFAGUTUUei4/0.jpg,[],0,"Created February 11, 2017",Lamis Kola is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","£2,530 raised of £2,500 goal"

He's also a proud man with a strong work ethic and the ingrained belief that one should always make it with your own effort, so it's very difficult for him to ask for help. But he is struggling and starting to lose hope. In addition to other health issues, he has a progressively worsening serious heart condition and will be having a VAD installed, and may utlimately end up having a heart transplant. This is a harsh reality for a man only in his 50's. In addition to the stress and anxiety of dealing with the uncertainties concerning his health, he is now hit with the mounting financial strain of not having been able to work for 2+ months.  Even if he is able to return  to work part time -- which he is trying to do but it is uncertain whether physically he will be able to do so because of his health conditions -- it won't be enough.  Although Jim has begun the process for a disability claim, approval is months away at best, and longer at worst.  In the meantime he needs to stay afloat somehow - that's where he needs our help. Jim has tried and keeps getting kicked to the curb to the point it is difficult not to just give up.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/bronzestar,Fallen WWII Hero's Memorial,"The world lost another treasure 2 days ago when the lord ordered SSgt James ""Jim"" Tuminello home to stand watch at the pearly gates. Jim was one of a rapidly decreasing population of World War II heroes and a member of the ""Greatest Generation."" Not only was Jim a Bronze Star recipient, he was also a loving husband to his wife Carmella of over 50 years, an amazing father to 5 beautiful daughters, and a fantastic grandfather to numerous grandkids. Jim was the ultimate definition of a family man, there is nothing he wouldn't do for his family, all the way up until his death he knew nothing but to give, he would literally give you the last dollar out of his wallet if he thought you needed it more than he did.... A few years ago, his body finally started to fail him, dimentia started to set in, he had various other illnesses that limited his mobility, and required constant care from his youngest daughter. However, this did not deter him from still living life to the fullest. He still would find a way to go work out in his garage, cut the grass and even try to fish! I had the opportunity a couple years ago to take him on one last visit to the cemetery to pay a visit to his wife who had passed and his oldest daughter. Little did i know at the time that would be the last.....However, the memories will be cherished forever.  Jim was a smart man and thought ahead and purchased his burial plot right in between his wife and oldest daughter, this way he will forever be with them, and only he would be able to come between them!  Unfortunately, this is where it brings us today...some unfortunate circumstances earlier this year, and one or two unscrupulous people, talked him out of cancelling his pre-paid funeral plans, and refunding the money to him. Leaving him with nothing for that fateful time, which has now come! Taking advantage of a man who is 97 years old, with dimentia is not cool in my book, and leaves us no choice but to ask for donations.   Your donations will go to help cover some basic funeral services, and to give this war hero the honors and send off he so rightly has earned and deserves. All funds will go towards, his transport from Arizona to Newport Beach, CA, embalming, a casket, a small and intimate memorial and ultimately his burial. His wishes are to be buried between his wife and daughter, and NOT to be cremated. I want to make sure that wish is granted, as it was previouslly arranged. Any remaining funds will immediately be donated in his name to a local veterans group such as the VFW, American Legion or Fallen Soldiers Fund.   ""SSgt Tuminello, during the heat of battle deep inside German lines, selflessly, put himself in harms way to protect his squad, in the middle of the road, and taking enemy fire, placed his BAR on the ground and began to open fire on the enemy, single handedly destroying 2 German machine guns nests, providing safe passage for the rest of his squad to advance. For these brave actions SSgt Tuminello is awarded the Bronze Star for heroism."" .......Was the write up from his commander.... We love you Gramps, and someday we will be reunited again.  PLEASE.. Share this with everyone you know, especially if you have connections to Veterens and other WWII veteren groups.  Lets give this hero a proper send off that he rightfully deserves.   Thank you and God Bless!!",https://images.gofundme.com/iBUlWgIsc6zn6Pd-GS9sKWyksKE=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17147288_1483394395.1822.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Dave N Shea is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$1,935 raised of $5,000 goal"

She quickly began chemotherapy, and we were released from the hospital on New Year's Eve. We rung in the New Year as a family at home, taking time together to prepare for the intense year ahead.  There are a variety of types of Lymphoma, and each type has a different course of treatment. For Maisie, we are fortunate that much of her treatment can be done outpatient. Her treatment plan has a high success rate, and we are nothing but optimistic about Maisie's prognosis. However, her treatment plan last approximately one year, with some medications continuing for a few months following treatment. In addition, we will continue to see doctors for years to come both to monitor the progress (or hopefully lack thereof) of the disease, as well as the potential long-term side effects of her chemotherapy and medications. Through all of this, Maisie has been incredible. She brings new meaning to words like ""strong"" and ""brave"". She is an inspiration to us all.  Due to Maisie's condition we will encounter unexpected expenses this year - a variety of medical expenses (insurance, treatment, medication, ER visits, hospital stays, missing days/weeks of work, weekly house cleaning to minimize Maisie's exposure to dust and germs).

On December 26, 2016, Robert was transporting my daughter back to her nursing home following her brief Christmas visit home - the first time she'd been able to come home in over a year.  I was travelling back with her, as I had felt the sudden need to go back with her.  Because of Robert's selfless acts of service, his loyalty to his passengers, his determination to protect us, and his sheer bravery, he saved my daughter's life and my own life during the I-17 freeway shootings in Phoenix.  (See T.V.

We wish to help reduce his economic burden as he heals from his wounds.  I greatly appreciate any financial help you may provide.  Details of our story are shared below. On December 26, 2016, while travelling south on  I-17 near the Thomas Road exit, heading back to the nursing home, traffic suddenly came to a halt.  As traffic veered to the left and the right from the center of the highway, we saw a white vehicle stopped in the middle of the road in front of us, with the trunk and driver door open. We saw a gunman come to the back of the car pointing his gun.  There was one car in front of us between the gunman and our handicapped van.  The gunman began firing gunshots - first aiming towards the car in front of us, which sped away.   The gunman then approached our handicapped van and pointed his gun at our vehicle. He then went to Robert's door and began beating on the window with his gun, yelling for our driver to get out of the vehicle.  We heard Robert emphatically yell back at the gunman: ""No Not This One"" - determined not to let this gunman take over our van.  The gunman then opened Robert's door, pointed his gun up towards Robert’s face and towards the back of the van where my daughter and I were sitting.  The gunman tried to pull Robert out of our van - trying to carjack our vehicle.  Robert quickly grabbed the gun with both hands, pulling it towards him and downward, so that he would not be shot in the head and be left unable to drive and so that we would not be shot.  While fighting off this gunman, Robert was shot and a bullet pierced a hole in his hand.   The gunman tried again to get into our vehicle to carjack it.  Although severely injured from the gunshot wound, Robert bravely found a way to push the gunman away.   (It was impossible for me to get my disabled daughter out of her wheelchair and onto the floor before the shooting began, so we could only sit and pray and try to call 911, while Robert fought to keep us safe.)  In yet another act of selfless service, with a hole in his bloody hand from the bullet wound, Robert drove us safely away about 4 miles down the highway. I had him pull over, asked to see his wound, which he was hiding to protect me from seeing the horrible sight.  There was blood everywhere.  I insisted that he let me help him wrap his wound, and we all waited in fear and shock for emergency help to arrive.  Despite seeing our lives flash before us, miraculously, our lives were spared that day. We are so thankful to our driver Robert. He was a real hero. He was not afraid to stand up to the gunman, and he put our safety ahead of his own.  Robert refused to let the gunman take control of our van because, as he told me, he knew that we were in the vehicle, and he felt he had to protect us and return us safely to my daughter's nursing home.  Robert was not about to turn us over to an armed gunman. We later learned that police had a shootout with the gunman on the I-17 after Robert drove us safely away from that scene.   Words cannot describe the horror of this incident, which has etched a place in our hearts and minds forever.  But what else is etched in our hearts and minds forever, are Robert's acts of heroism and selfless acts of service to me and to my daughter that day.  We are grateful for the miracles that saved our lives on December 26th - especially for Robert's quick and perfect actions, with very little time to think before he had to react to a real life and death situation. He did everything a true hero would do.  Thank you Robert!   Please help us give back to this true American Hero, so that he can receive financial help during his time of recovery.   His protection of me and my special daughter will never be forgotten.  I will sincerely appreciate any financial assistance you can donate to Robert, who protected not only me, but our daughter, who is one very special angel, as described below.   Tiffany joined our family in 1994 as a 2 year-old foster child.  At her tender young age, she had already suffered too much.  We were able to adopt her at age 4, and we have been blessed to be her parents and to work diligently to give her a better life, despite the impact upon her of her biological parents' poor choices.   Sadly, at 21 years of age, Tiffany was stricken with a severe case of mono, along with the onset of numerous neurological problems.  She has been in and out of hospitals and nursing homes for the past 3 years. She cannot stand or walk and has a very long list of health problems that require her to be cared for in a nursing home. She last lived at home on December 22, 2015, three days before Christmas 2015, when she had to be hospitalized again.  Thus, we were never able to have Christmas 2015.  And she has never been able to come home until a year later, on Christmas Eve 2016, when she came for a 2-day visit.   While our visit with her was wonderful, her departure from our home on December 26th, and the need for her to return to the nursing home, was sad for us.  We had family prayer before she left, praying amongst other things, that she would have a safe journey back. As the time came for her to get into the van with Robert to return to her nursing home, I was strongly inspired that I needed to go with her, and I did.  Now I know why. The trauma upon her would have much worse had she been alone in the back of that van during that horrific crime. I am her legal guardian, advocate and protector, and she and I are thankful I was there that day. Despite having much of the life she knew stripped away from her at the young age of 21, and despite being confined to a nursing home, Tiffany has served as a special friend to many - both young and old alike, who have ended up in her nursing homes. She has selflessly served so many disabled patients. She has comforted and uplifted many individuals in her nursing homes. She has put smiles on so many patients, even those who would not respond to anyone else.  Tiffany has succeeded in getting patients to come out of their rooms and go on outings when they would never do so before. She has blessed and inspired caregivers. She has been called a ""special angel"" by so many who have cared for her or interacted with her. Tiffany has persevered through so much tragedy in her life, and yet she still serves and inspires others.  We are grateful to Robert for saving her life and for allowing her to still be on this earth today to continue blessing the lives of others, regardless of what her own future may bring. Thank you again for your donations to our hero Robert!",https://images.gofundme.com/CeSpVDU1uUx-eX0KjUEaKmgRoS0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17147746_1483662835.7237.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Regina Pangerl is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Robert Braaksma.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,760 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/joshua-heart,JOSHUA'S HEART,"My name is China Cruz and I would like to take this opportunity to share this heartbreaking story about my son, Joshua Cruz, with all of my friends and family.I am doing so with the hope that none of you will ever have to face what we as a family are now facing.    My son, Joshua is a 34 year old man with a wonderful wife Martha, and two beautiful children, Destiny age 14 and Damien age 10.  This past March, while at work one day, Joshua experienced chest pains and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance.  A multitude of tests and blood work were performed over the next several days to determine the cause of the chest pain.         Ultimately, we were given news we did not want to hear.  Joshua’s heart is weak and functioning at only 43%. This news was heartbreaking and life changing for him and the entire family.  As any family would do, we all came together to support Josh and to give him the strength he needed to endure such news and face reality during this very difficult time.      Since March, he has been in and out of the hospital numerous times and attends doctor visits regularly. During one of these visits, we received even worse news.  Joshua’s heart percentage continues to rapidly decrease and it is now functioning at only 34%. The walls of his heart continue to thicken and cannot pump in a normal rhythm.  It was during one of the more recent visits when things took a turn for the worst.  We received the most devastating news that no mother, wife, or child wants to hear.  We were informed that Joshua has only few years to live.  To say that we were crushed is an understatement.  It was the most heartbreaking and devastating moment of our entire lives that no parent or child should ever have to endure.      The next step was a referral for treatment at Newark Beth Israel Hospital.  The team of doctor’s and nurses there were great and Joshua quickly underwent a catheterization, during which his breathing had stopped.  On August 30th, he was once again admitted to the hospital after feeling as though his symptoms had worsened.  Tests were again performed and it turned out his heart had now dropped to 20%.  This news meant two things- his lifespan had now decreased and he was forced to wear a life vest 24/7.  On October 6th, after four hours of surgery, Joshua received a defibrillator, which sits above his heart and has three stems connecting to the heart. The recovery was long and painful as a result of internal bleeding and an infection.     For those of you who do not know my son, he is a very funny, strong minded, intelligent, caring, loving, individual.  He has devoted his life to being a great father, husband, and provider for his family.  These health issues have placed both emotional and financial burdens on my son and our family, since he is no longer able to work.  His disability checks have long ended, which has resulted in them becoming a single income household.  My daughter in-law is now struggling to balance work, children, the home, and her career, all while caring for a sick husband and meeting the demands of his ongoing appointments.  My granddaughter Destiny will be graduating from 8th grade this coming June and plans for her next educational step have been put on hold because of these unforeseen circumstances. We are asking for any monetary donation, big or small, to assist my son and his family with the surmounting medical bills and daily living expenses.  Any donation would go a long way and be greatly appreciated.  It will help my son focus on gaining the strength he needs for his recovery. I sincerely thank each of you for taking time out of your busy lives to read this and I hope that no family ever has to endure the pain that is now our reality.",https://images.gofundme.com/LQl_fydl1lwUleVnAAg8nIQwVoM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17148144_1484774168.002.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",China Cruz is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Joshua Cruz.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,180 raised of $25,000 goal"

The group is now currently focusing on raising funds through fundraisers, private donations, and grant monies to go towards the costs of improving the dog park to include agility equipment, landscaping, and other amenities within the park. GDOG was founded by local citizen Catherine Mahoney after her dog, Oso’s death in March of 2011, while he was exercising off-leash at Bicentennial Park. Oso was a fun-loving dog who was curious about everything. He was a shiba inu and everyone who knows about shiba inus knows that they are free-spirited and they need the space to run off leash. Catherine has since vowed to create The O-SO Fun Dog Park to prevent further tragedies such as this from happening. GDOG hopes to raise $100,000 in a year through generous donations so that they can finish the final touches to The O-SO Fun Dog Park to make it O-SO wonderful! Together we can bring tremendous improvements to the park. GDOG is O-SO grateful for your consideration to donate to its cause.

We  learned that our mom was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer.  We thought it would end there, however, the cancer has metastasized to other areas of her body to include spine, rib cage, and other bones. (Stage 4) Our mom will be needing both chemotherapy and radiation for treatment along with other procedures like MRI's CT scans, surgeries, prescriptions, etc.Her treatment starts this week and she could use help as soon as possible. Due to the new year that means starting over with a  high deductible along with a high out of pocket max. She's also unable to work which limits her income to pay household bills. Our mother means so much to us and our family. She is our rock, our glue and our biggest supporter. There will never be anyone on God's green earth who will love us like she does. She is the most selfless person  we know-always giving of herself so readily without doubt or question.  Our mother not only means so much to us but she also means so much to so many other people from the teenagers she works with everyday for the last 25 years to the countless strangers she ministers to on a daily basis. (Mom has a prison ministry but if you know her, you know she will minister to anyone. You can be standing in line at a grocery store and she will pray for you!) She has touched so many lives in such a positive, heartfelt way. Somehow, we always hear from the people who have met her and they always have the same thing to say-""I just love your Mom!"" The doctor feels that our mother still has a really good chance at fighting this disease. We want to do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING we can to keep her around for a really long time. We need her here! She has more souls to reach and more lives to bless! She also has many more unnecessary trips to  Bucees (her favorite place other than church) and more Christian Rap songs to write like  her latest hit, ""Get On Up!"" a family favorite! (Yes, she's that awesome!)Our family would be so thankful and appreciative of ANY amount you could give.

In March of 2016 I enrolled in ITT Tech, majoring in computer drafting and design, as a step toward achieving my goal of becoming a civil engineer and hotel designer. Unknown to me at the time, the school was in financial trouble and shut down six months later. All of my finances and college credits were lost. I am in the process of re-applying to a program at University of the Arts in Philadelphia and hope to enroll as early as summer semester of 2017. However, because the school I was enrolled in shut down so abruptly, my loans have been put on hold. I cannot currently apply for the loans I will need to begin taking course this summer. With the grants available to me I will still need to pay a sum of $20,000.00 to start classes at University of the Arts for the summer semester. I am working full time at UPS but my tuition benefits with them will not kick in for another year. Due to the setbacks I encountered over the summer I have been under financial strain - even working full time I have not been able to save money towards tuition as it all goes towards bills and food. It has always been a dream of mine to be a hotel designer. I have worked incredibly hard to get to where I can actually see it becoming a reality. I was raised to work for everything that I receive, and am uncomfortable asking for financial help. But I want to achieve my goals, and to do that I am forced to recognize the limitations of my circumstances and humbly ask for your support. Anything that you can donate would be greatly appreciated.

Our goal around that message is to build a facility from a renovated firehouse that provides a safe place for young men and women to gather and get educated on the dangers of drug and alcohol addiction, in addition to gang prevention and intervention. A place where mentors are there to help navigate teens towards a positive future. A place with information and resources for desperate parents and teens to get answers. We will have scheduled drug, alcohol, and gang education classes, along with parenting classes for families with at risk children. Relentless Rescue will provide academics, arts, and athletics for young people to find a passion far away from negative influences. We want teens to walk through our doors knowing they will be welcomed without judgement into a place where they will always find encouragement and understanding.My name is Juaquin Fabela, president of Relentless Rescue. I am a former gang member and alcoholic who was on a path to nowhere. Seventeen years ago I made a life changing decision to stop the negativity and begin a life serving God through the mentorship I found at an outreach sports center. Since then I have had the honor and opportunity of speaking to over 1 million young people throughout the United States on the consequences of bad decisions. I have received numerous awards for my advocacy dealing with teens and young adults, and now I am ready to build a facility that in turn, will do what was done for me. Through my experiences I've found that it is a whole lot easier to prevent young men and women from becoming addicts and/or gang members, than it is to try and fix the problem once it's already begun. Help us fight for the future of our children...the victory is WORTH the fight!Relentless Rescue will be a place with a fully functioning stage to be used for various performing arts inclusive of- spoken word, musical performances, stage presentations, and theatrics, etc. This space houses an upstairs area that can provide a social setting for group activities or even a quiet place for studying and homework. There will also be an onsite snack and coffee bar with Wifi access throughout the center. The outside area will feature a weight facility, volleyball court, BBQ, and firepit. This will be a cutting edge and safe place for families and friends to spend their time.Relentless Rescue is a proud supporter and partner of organizations such as New Hope Street Ministry who go out faithfully every Saturday rain or shine to feed the homeless, as well as Unseen Youth who travel to Cambodia to fight sex trafficking.We need your support to make all of these life saving dreams become a reality.

It is a copper deficiency disease and because of the inabiity of his body to absorb copper and protect  his brain, multiple seizures become a daily occurence.

However, whatever goes over what the bills end up being are going to go to a memorial fund that will be set up in Juan Colon's name for art.  Here is the story: That's my Kiddo's eye. Sadly, she also had a broken jaw to go with it. On the 29th, when Lindsay and her friend Cynetta were walking to the East room, a group of girls jumped on her friend Cynetta. Lindsay tried to get them off of her, and in turn was attacked. During the melee, she was tripped and her jaw was broken on the curb. Her eye was injured after everyone was separated and while she was holding her jaw, a girl snuck behind her and hit her from behind.She called me, her friends rushing to Northwestern. After my latest interactions with Northwestern emergency I said no way, go to Rush Presbyterian. We met there, kiddo was bleeding from her mouth, swollen jaw, and her eye looking as it does. We literally could not find the entrance there, so we went to Stroger.When was the last time you got in, seen, a CT scan, evaluated, and discharged within 2 hours from an e.r.? Ever? That was a miracle, and I thank the staff there profusely. However, regardless of how excellent they are, I wanted the best surgeon to do the procedure to fix her. And that is when my boy above Oz Schoenstadt reached in. Called his daughter Rose Andron, she got us in to see one of the best docs at Rush Dr. Peter Revenaugh within hours. The day before New Year's, and hours before the memorial for my boy Juan. He looked at the scans that Stroger provided, saw the fractures, and will be putting in two plates tomorrow and wiring her jaw shut for 4-6 weeks, and yet the most upset Lindsay was thinking she was disappointing me was by not being able to bartend my boy Juan's memorial.I thank whatever power there is above that it wasn't worse. That no one had a knife, or a gun. That Lindsay didn't pass out and got beaten worse. That Rose will be watching over my daughter while the doc fixes her. It won't be cheap (anywhere from 10-20 grand) but I want the best for kiddo, and insurance really doesn't cover any of that. So if you want to help, I want to make this offer. Whatever you give you get back, weather it is thru a dinner, or a concert, or babysitting, or gymnastics lessons or audio equipment, you will get your investment back. I'll know how much it is after the surgery.I will know more tomorrow after the surgery, and will post updates, but the important thing is that she will be OK, and she has a wolverine like healing factor, and that she did the right thing trying to protect her friend. I'm proud of her. She gets wired shut tomorrow for 4-6 weeks, but please text her and send her well wishes.

After having a very hard labor and being scared to death that me or my baby might not survive I was diagnosed a week later with a rare heart condition called peripartum cardiomyopathy. I never in my life expected that I would be diagnosed with a rare heart condition keeping me from returning to work. This has been very devastating news to me but I'm trying to fight it. Basically what all the fancy words mean is that the left part of my heart is only working at 15% and so it's very hard for me to do things that normal people my age due including just carrying my baby! It sort of feels like I'm breathing through Swiss cheese lungs.. if you have any questions I'd be glad to give you more info on my condition. Since the diagnosis: I've Lost my job (I am not able to perform the duties)I have lost my medical coverage(which I had through my job) I can not get any assistance because unbeknownst to me the medical coverage that I was paying for didn't include temporary disability. My husband lost his job in October and continues to search for work day after day. I've been on countless meds but my heart has not really improved in the last 5 months.This is only a small list of the trials I have been facing, and through it all I have been working as much as I can babysitting, which is still very hard on me but I have no other choice and it is not enough to cover everything. It kills me to not be able to do what I am used to because I have worked hard my entire life, and I am at the point where I need to ask for help because at this time I feel time I have no other alternatives. The medical bills are going to start piling up. Not to mention the costs of having a new baby and he needs basic necessities. I need to be able to travel to doctors appointments and pay for the appointments and make sure that my baby is cared for. My latest doctor told me that I may need a heart transplant and I do not know how I will be able to have that happen without medical insurance. I am seeing a peripartum cardiomyopathy specialist this month, and I hope he has better news for me. If anyone could help me with these costs I will be so grateful for your kindness and generosity and once I beat this awful condition I will be sure to pay it forward.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/will-seawright-memorial,Will Seawright Memorial,"On January 6, 2013, we lost a friend, a brother, a son, an uncle, and an Ole Miss Rebel.  William “Will” J. Seawright did not have to work hard to make friends.  He was a young man who carried a smile that was contagious.  If you were with Will you were going to be happy regardless of whether you grew up with Will in Pontotoc, Mississippi, were Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers, befriended Will at Ole Miss, bonded with him in Dallas, Texas, or met him in Jackson, Mississippi. He always helped create a memory, and to return the favor it is our hope to make his memory everlasting.On the weekend of May 20, 2017, a group of Will’s fraternity brothers are coming together to celebrate 20 years of friendship.  Although he will not be able to be with us physically, he will certainly be there with us in spirit.  With the support of friends and family, in an effort to remember Will at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house in Oxford, we have set a goal to raise $15,000.These funds will be used to purchase new benches for the front porch with a marker in Will’s memory.  In addition, the remaining funds will be used as a gift to the Ole Miss Alumni Association for purposes of a marker in Will’s memory on the Ole Miss Campus- as a Life Member of the Ole Miss Alumni Associate and #1 Ole Miss Rebel Fan!Please help us meet our goal to remember Will.  We know that Will would be humbled to know his name will be permanent on a place he loved so dearly at The University of Mississippi.  Thank you and God Bless.",https://images.gofundme.com/Zk0Hb7yTFdtTDDFMmiglLH3GuWQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1483401277.2495.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068464.1072_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068496.8995_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068530.2944_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068606.664_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068141.5708_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068160.4863_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067919.0184_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067941.718_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067964.4077_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067991.4717_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068010.5074_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068032.1148_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068053.0924_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068070.3538_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067852.5335_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067866.4975_funddescription.jpg']",16,"Created January 2, 2017",Garnet Reynolds is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$9,765 raised"

He has a wonderful wife and family that he loves with his whole being, a job he has mastered, and an outlook on life that, well, we should all have.Think of cancer. It's miserable. It disrupts family as it seems that is it's only job; it pulls life out of too many.This past October, Bob had an appointment with his primary doctor, Dr. Schafer at IHS. He went in for nothing more than a mere check-up for his back, shoulders and something in his eye. After his screening, Dr. Schafer ordered some tests. A PSA blood test revealed Bob’s levels were at 7.5 (at his age, they should be no higher than 2.5), thus Bob was referred to Dr. Sawchuck, a urology specialist at Sanford in Fargo. At his first Sanford appointment, they checked his PSA levels again; the results prompted a biopsy of his prostrate, which took place on October 31st. Just prior to departing for the Mahnomen Indians football game in the Fargodome on November 3rd, Bob and Jackie received the news of the biopsy results: cancer in two spots. At a consult with Dr. Sawchuck on November 17th, surgery to remove Bob’s prostrate was recommended, due to his age, the stage of the cancer and other factors. This recommendation was confirmed by a urology specialist at the Mayo Clinic on December 7th. Due to the recovery time needed after the biopsy, surgery wasn't scheduled until Tuesday, January 17th. Post surgery recovery will be several weeks.Bob, Jackie, Bobby and Gabe will leave on Sunday, January 15th. Dusty, Madi and Desiree will also go, but as work allows. They will need to be in Rochester for the week; even after discharge, it is not recommended that Bob make the long car trip home for at least a day or so.Go back to Bob. He's the definition of happy and go-lucky. His smile is contagious. His generosity is endless. Many know him for his mad (meat) smoking skills. Others know Bob for his wood work and building skills. Others for his love - love of family, love of sports (especially those his boys play), love of fishing and hunting, and of course for living another day of adventure (he is, after all, Jackie’s adult child).This fund has been set-up to help Bob, Jackie and kids for traveling expenses (lodging, food, gas and any miscellaneous expenses that pop up), as well as loss of time and wages from Jackie’s job.Life is an adventure, and this is just a bump in the road of Bob’s adventure. Think of him and his family. Say a prayer, or many. Donate what you can, because anything will help. Think of Bob. He’s happy. He has a wonderful wife and family he loves with his whole being. And he’s going to beat cancer.(Bob and Jackie’s children and grandchildren thank everyone in advance. Prayers, positive messages and any donations means so much. Living in a community that stands together is priceless. And although it was hard for Bob to agree to a GoFundMe page, their kids don't want Jackie and Bob to worry about anything other than beating cancer, ensuring many more years of family, love and adventure. Also, we all want to thank those who are watching over Bob and Jackie’s house and volunteering in so many other ways.)",https://images.gofundme.com/siUnfy15qlayRcyffxOk9lXD_Oc=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17150142_14834037810_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Joan LaVoy is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jackie Bjorge.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,295 raised of $4,000 goal"

However it's also expensive, and  crucial to the educational path I'd like to be on. The school is a Mortuary Archaeology school based in Poland , and as somebody who wants to have a career in Forensic Anthropology, work in the field is crucial- not only for being successful- but also for being able to become a certified member of the ABFA (American Board of Forensic Anthropology).  As of now, I have gathered enough funds to pay the cost of the field school, but it doesn't leave me with much. Certainly not enough for a plane ticket, or supplies for the trip. If any of you could donate or help, it would mean a huge amount to me- as this trip is an amazing opportunity for me, and also! is educationally beneficial!

He is 6' tall and weighs approximately 115 pounds. Gastroparesis is a disease that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Food sits in his stomach and starts rotting. When this happens, He gets horrible stinky and very painful burps and then he starts throwing up. There is no cure for this horrible disease. Every day, he throws up multiple times. He had been in and out of hospitals and ER departments for years. They can't or won't do anything for him anymore except give him an iv for fluids and medicate him. They even release him if he is still throwing up, saying they can't do anything more for him. When he gets home from these visits, it takes him days to get all the meds out of his system and then he is back to throwing up again. It is a never ending cycle. He had stopped going to ER's as it is just too hard on him and his body. Instead he stays at home in bed when he has a bad GP episode and works through it himself. These episodes usually last anywhere from 4-7 days at a time. It breaks my heart to see my son so sick and in so much pain all the time. I can't keep a job as when he is sick, I need to be home to take care of him. He is also a type 1 Diabetic since 2004 and it is crucial that he keep his sugar levels as low as possible. This is extremely difficult to do when he is throwing up all the time. The times when he can eat a little, he will take insulin for what he eats, but then he throws up his food and then his sugars get all out of whack!Also due to his constant throwing up, his teeth are rotting and falling out. He needs extensive dental work done that we can't afford. I have created this campaign for my son to request help for my son to get to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota as we have been told they have the best GI department.   There is also a doctor/surgeon in Indiana that does stomach removal. Also need help with money for extensive dental work before his teeth all fall out. Please note that I, Leslie Wessels, Gregs Mom,  created this campaign for my son, Gregory Wessels and that I maintain and manage this campaign for him.  I will withdraw the funds received for Gregs medical needs, as needed.  Thank you for reading our story and if you can, please help my son with a donation.  We both would appreciate it very much!Thank you,Leslie (Greg's Mom)",https://images.gofundme.com/CK7_ykVBBzayYnaa6m1nBtGttUg=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17150220_1502317054.2432.jpg,[],0,"Created March 13, 2017",Leslie Wessels is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,620 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ashleyyogainstructor,Help Ashley Become A Yoga Instructor,"Hello all! If you've found yourself to this page, then it's probably no surprise to you that I'm passionate about weight loss, exercise, yoga, and all around physical fitness.You may already know my story, but if not, let me give you a brief summary. Almost 4 years ago, I was told by my doctors that if I didn't lose weight that I would soon be diagnosed with diabetes, would have to remain on high blood pressure medication for my entire life, would continue to struggle with asthma, and wouldn't be able to have children. I truly felt like my quality of life was slim to none. I was slowly killing myself and was very quickly losing my entire future. Something inside of me finally WOKE UP. I joined Weight Watchers and over the course of 2 years lost 147 pounds naturally. All by eating right and exercising. I have maintained my weight loss since then. Over the past year and a half, I've become more and more passionate about yoga and fitness in general. So passionate, actually, that I knew during my weight loss that I would eventually want to invest in a career in the fitness/health field. I have two goals: to become a personal trainer and a yoga instructor. Today, I'd like to talk about the latter goal. I'm tired of working a basic 9-5 job that simply ""pays the bills"". I want a career that fuels my soul, challenges my body, and encourages/betters others.  I want to become a yoga instructor to show others the potential their body holds. If someone would have told me 4 years ago that I would one day be physically healthy, I don't know if I would have believe them.

She would later take on the name Kathryn Dalton Magana after marrying Larry Magana whom she loved a lot. She lived a full life in her short 54 years. She is the baby of four siblings; Hugh, Dorothy, and Tommy. At the age of 9 she lost her mother to cancer. Then at the age of 15 she lost her father to heart complications. As a teenager she had her siblings to keep her going. She learned how to be an adult early. No matter what life dealt her she overcame. Most of all she loved every person she met. Kathy helped anyone that needed it. She opened her home to all who did not have one. No one was turned away. Kathy was loving until then end. She went to sleep on January 2, 2017 at 1:13PM. As we now prepare for her to be laid to rest the cost is extremely high. We have set a goal that would cover the expenses. This includes the funeral ceremony in Austin, TX. The travel expense to lay her to rest in Pearland, TX. The thing that means the most to the family is she is laid to rest with her parents and grandparents in Pearland. Whatever you can give will bless the family and lift some of the burden. Please know the family would love to continue to receive your thoughts and prayers. It means the world to us. Thank you for your time and consideration. With Love,Larry, Kristy, Brandie, Joseph, & Family*Joseph Astran, Kathy's son, will be handling the funds to insure all cost are covered.

Specifically she, and Doug's kids, will be using these finances to pay for:-cremation-venue rental for the Illinois memorial-any and all supplies needed to publicize the memorials in Illinois, Texas & California-any unexpected autopsy and medical bills-airfare for her and Doug's children to attend the memorials-grief counseling & management for her and Doug's childrenWe were unsure of what the monetary goal for Doug's Go Fund Me should be because so many details of possible medical expenses are still up in the air. So, if a $10,000 goal seems like too much, rest assured that all donations will go towards Doug's funeral arrangements with any surplus going to his kids. All expenses will be itemized on this page so donors will be aware of where the funds were finally allocated. These funds will be needed fairly soon as Bun E. and Doug's kids have already started planning the Memorial. Bun E. will be in charge of all of the final expenses.So, I just want to thank all donors in advance for your kindness in helping out Bun E. and the kids. The unexpected nature of his death has made this an extremely hard and emotional time for all of them. Doug was one of the most generous people I know and, I know he'd be heartbroken if he knew his passing had financially burdened his loved ones. He, like me, might have figured he was invincible--that 53 was young or that he'd still be kicking it at 80. Who needs to plan for dying? Pfffttt.........We'll all miss you Doug.

We need another $21,000 to make this project a success and a reality.Lemosho Primary School is located to the west of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The school has a tremendous need for renovation to support the learning and education of the children the school serves. Julius Mtongore (best known as Whitey) is a professional Tanzanian mountain guide with over 12 years of experience leading expeditions on Kilimanjaro. He is also one of the premier mountain guides for Ahsante Tours, a local family owned tour company based in Kilimanjaro. Julius has been leading fundraising expeditions for overseas charities for thousands of clients around the world.This month he will be reaching beyond the borders of Tanzania to conquer another one of the world's ""7 summits"" to raise money for the Lemosho Primary School. Whitey plans to use this opportunity to promote awareness of the renovation of the school. This will be an incredible journey for ""Whitey"" as he will be one of only a few Tanzanians to ever climb this mountain.The goals for this campaign is to raise $50,000 USD. The school has 1,079 students and only 7 classrooms. The money will be spent to rebuild 2 of the classrooms. The plan is to re-build the 2 classrooms and if possible get a 3rd classroom built. We plan to fundraise over the next 2 months so that construction starts in March.Generations of children will benefit from this project because we hope that Whitey’s journey will help inspire more Tanzanian’s to make a difference.

Most, if not all her life, she has lived for her family...but as of November she has had to turn the attention on herself when she was diagnosed with stage two cervical cancer. But let’s just back up for a second. This is the mother who is caring and nurturing. Who is a problem solver and the person to go to for a quick laugh and a more lengthy hug. The one who always makes time for anyone, no matter their age. Her children are proof of that.She’s determined and driven. She volunteered at the high school the twins attend and cooked meals for their football programs. She was one of many who cheered on the sidelines of so many BLHS football games, all the while students coming by to give her hugs or high fives. She is a person who is easily loved.She decided to make the monumental decision to go back to school in her thirties for elementary education and has just recently started her profession as a teacher. Her school kids adore her and {we’re pretty certain!} she feels the same about them. She has most certainly found her groove at Lafayette, but due to the cancer treatment, she will not be able to return to teaching until at least April.Late December, her cervical cancer was upgraded to stage three as it had spread to the lymph system.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/allie-colt-brain-cancer-fund,Allie T Colt Brain Cancer Fund,"I'm so very sorry and truly embarrassed that I have to ask my friends, my family and even complete strangers for financial help, but I've exhausted every other available option. I love Allie more than life itself. I will do anything humanly possible to help save her life. I’m her full time caretaker and while being self-employed has benefited my schedule, it has cut my income by almost 30% in the last year.  We have tried to get funding through insurance, charity groups, state Medicare and various cancer foundations, but Allie is in a catch 22 situation. For those of you who do not know her history, she really is a warrior! Three and a half years ago, when she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she was given 6 months to live and only a 30% chance of making it out of surgery. While her brain surgery went well, her chemo and radiation treatments almost killed her. The chemo completely blew out her autoimmune system.  Leaving Allie to suffer from Aplastic anemia, which is very rare with only about 800 cases diagnosed a year. She also has a rare form of leukemia, which means her blood cells don't mature. They call it M.D.S (myelodysplastic syndrome) which is causing her to be  neutropenic. Basically this all means that Allie needs a bone marrow transplant because her bone marrow will not produce red cells, white cells or platelets.Because Allie’s brain tumor is an Astrocytoma (aggressive stage three cancer), insurance will not even consider covering the bone marrow transplant until the cancer is in remission. The catch is that the cancer will not go into remission without her autoimmune system being healthy. Currently, Allie gets infusions of blood and platelets at least once, sometimes twice, a week.  The infusions are keeping her alive, but they do nothing to help her heal. She needs the bone marrow transfusion for that.All of her doctors agree that they can't fight the cancer, or the other adverse health effects, until the bone marrow transplant is completed successfully. They are saying that a bone marrow transplant is the only chance Allie has to beat the cancer into remission. The good news is that they found 3 donor matches. One is even here in Illinois. The bad news is that her transplant surgery will cost in excess of $350,000 dollars. And that’s just for the surgery.That doesn't include compensation to the donor, her organ transplant medication (estimated to be $5,000 each month), any extended hospital stays, follow up M.R.I's, other medications, tests and things we haven’t even thought of yet. They have told me the medical expenses would be in excess of $1,000,000 over the first 10 years.I realize it’s the worst time of year to be asking people for donations, but Allie's chances of beating this go down with every day, week and month that goes by.It would be easiest and least burdensome if a lot of people were able to give a small amount of money than it would be for a few people to give lot of money. So I was hoping I could appeal to your sense of competition and make this a game of sorts.If each of you were able to donate between $10 to $100 and then recruit just two friends to also donate $10 to $100, with the commit of getting two of their friends to do the same, we would have the money in no time. No one would have to give big money, but we could still save Allie's life. For such a small amount of money, you can feel good about yourself and you will have me forever grateful and in your debt. All the money collected will go directly to offset the cost of surgery and medical bills. If anyone has advice or ideas on how I can raise the money quicker or easier, please don’t be shy. I welcome all the ideas and any advice I can get. Whether you are able to donate to Allie's fight or not, I would like to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read this and to consider donating.Please help if you can.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36l8wwo,Carol Nagy Newton&family fundraiser,"As most of you know my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer a few months ago. Since she found out she has gone through so much. She underwent surgery Dec 2nd to remove the cancer and we were told they were successful at removing it all. She had some complications and had to be transferred to London hospital as part of her lung collapsed and she needed a drainage tube put in. After she returned to Windsor she was getting much better and was able to come home to us finally. She was doing great and her breathing was good and her pain was under control but she still had the drainage tube in and needed a nurse to come every day to give her IV antibiotics. Thursday morning Dec 29th while the nurse was here she noticed blood in her tube and the nurse suggested that she go to the hospital to get checked out. They did a chest X-ray and CT scan and said everything looked good and that she was healing fine and sent her home. That evening she was feeling fine and watching a movie with my step dad Terry when all of a sudden she started to cough up blood. She yelled to me to come quickly as I did and when I got to her she was vomiting blood badly and was choking on it. She couldn't breath and I called 911. With the help of my neighbor , good friend, EMS and firefighters they were able to get her intabated. She suffered a heart attack along the way and her heart stopped and they had to revive her. She is now at Windsor Regional Hospital Ouellette campus in ICU. She is nowhere near out of the woods. The MRI shows she has a lot of brain damage from the lack of oxygen but the doctors want to wait a couple more days to see if she heals more and gets stronger then maybe she will start responding. Our family needs your help. This is so very hard for me to do and I would never ever ask for money but at this point in time I have no choice. My step dad Terry is still trying to work as we need the money but it isnt even close enough to pay for everything. My mom has been off work with no income and I have little to none myself as I myself am injuried and haven't been able to work. My step dad is a great man and is doing his best to provide for us but this has taken such a toll on him mentally and it's taking time away from being with my mom who needs him desperately right now. He has already taken many unpaid days off work since my mom has been sick.

Many people wonder how I ended up about 4,000 miles away from my home. Well, my country has been going through governmental corruption which has brought forth inequality for a very extended period of time and the problem never seems to cease. I am tired of seeing children who lack food or clothes, getting addicted to drugs and adjusting to a system of mediocrity and limitless pain and suffering. I am also tired of seeing my country’s authorities gain unjust wealth as a result of corruption by turning a blind eye to all these issues. As I grew up, I realized my country’s situation and I figured I could not keep living in a place where all these inequities went unnoticed, so I decided I wanted to study Political Science, so that someday, I will be able to do what my authorities have failed to do for a long time: create efficient and empathetic policies to generate equal opportunities for all the citizens regardless of their socio-economic status. Now, I am making my dream a reality. The Department of State of the United States awarded me with a scholarship called, “Opportunity Funds”, the scholarship covered my flight tickets to the university, as well as full coverage of standardized tests that I had to take in order to apply to different schools. Last year, I paid the remaining balance left on my tuition through raffles I organized, a scholarship from the Paraguayan-Kansas Committee, as well as other donations, and an offer from a professor to live at his place for my first year; which I feel very blessed and thankful about. For the second semester of my sophomore year, I am needing the quantity of USD 1,650 for my tuition and USD 482 for health insurance coverage. I will really appreciate your help no matter how much you can assist me with my educational journey.

He served in Korea from 1957-1958. He worked as a driver for the Chestnut Ridge Bus Company for 30 years and still currently works there as a monitor. He's well-known throughout the East Ramapo School District as he's driven for most of the schools. He is well-liked and respected by kids, parents, and school personell throughout the district. Kuch joined The Brewer Fire Engine Company #1 (""Monsey"") in 1953 and is the oldest active member of the company. He continues to frequent the firehouse daily, cleaning and ordering supplies, helping out in any way he can. He served as Captain of the Fire Police and is honored to have volunteered his last 63 years to serve with that company and continues to do so. We his family, in conjunction with the Monsey Fire Department, are launching this page/fund for Kuch in an effort to assist with the ongoing costs that are accumulating as a result of his recent diagnosis.

He doesn't take kindly to help of any kind, which is why his friends and family are reaching out here. We appreciate any donations of any amount to help lighten the financial burden due to the rising costs associated with his diagnosis.

Thank you so much for visiting this page and thinking of me.  A group of leaders from my church will be traveling to Israel in February 2017, and it's truly on my heart to join this trip. This is a two-fold mission. We will walk where Jesus walked, experiencing God intimately and encountering the Biblical world, from which the scriptures emerged. Also, we will meet and learn from Israeli and Palestinian people – from leaders to refugees, as we seek to understand the complexities of the current political, religious and humanitarian crisis in Israel. Our goal is to return as transformed individuals, with our hearts and eyes open to the tremendous grief, anger, fear and suffering felt by Israeli and Palestinian people.  We pray that this experience would help us to build bridges across lines of conflict and to be better advocates for peace and justice.  The trip will take place in partnership with local friends at National Community Church and Telos Group, a nonprofit organization that equips leaders to advocate for a pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, pro-peace solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Telos is building and equipping a network of church leaders who view peacemaking as a core component of Christian discipleship and are willing to be partners for peace in Israel/Palestine and beyond.In 2017, this will be my first step in a lifelong commitment to understanding, defending and promoting the peace and flourishing of all people, in the Middle East and the world. I am so thankful beyond words for this opportunity to serve God's people and to follow His call to be Peacemaker. How You Can Help With this trip comes great financial expenses -- To participate, the amount I'd need to fundraise is $3,800  by February 8th (ahh so soon!) I am hopeful that all funds can be raised by then. Your donation will help me to cover all travel expenses, which are roundtrip airfare and transportation between Washington, D.C. and Israel, meals, lodging and insurance for safety during the riskier parts of the trip. Any amount received is so appreciated. I am also so thankful for those who can support me in prayers for safety and wisdom during this trip, and for the dignity, security and freedom of the people in Israel.Thank you in advance for your prayers and financial support.

I have committed myself to riding in the 2017 Police Unity Tour. The Police Unity Tour is a group of incredibly dedicated people made up of Law Enforcement Officers and survivors of Law Enforcement Officers that have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. This group of people, in particular Chapter IX, make a yearly bicycle ride from Philadelphia, PA to Washington, D.C. The purpose of this ride is to raise public awareness of those officers whom have made the ultimate sacrifice. The secondary purpose of the Police Unity Tour is to raise the much needed funds for the upkeep and maintenance of the memorial, memorial grounds, and the soon to be opening National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Museum.Every 56 hours in the United States of America, a Law Enforcement Officer is killed in the line of duty. In 2016, 139 Law Enforcement Officers and over 35 Police K9's lost their lives.In my years as a Constable, I have been to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial many times. To see it and experience it from a spectators point of view is absolutely breathtaking. Unfortunately, in my years in law enforcement, I have also seen at least 8 people that I have known be added to that wall. Nothing, hits home as hard to a Law Enforcement Officer as seeing somebody's name that you have a personal connection to added to that wall. To see their survivors, whose lives have been shattered as their loved one has been taken way too soon, also staring at that wall, is heartbreaking. It reminds me how lucky I am, but it also reminds me to never forget them. Please help me make sure that each Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Son or Daughter will NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!Each rider is responsible for raising $1,750.00 to ride. This money goes to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and Museum. The rider does not keep any money. I am asking for your donation to help me meet the $1,750 that I am committed to raising. If there is anything that you can do to help me, it would be greatly appreciated! Every dollar helps!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/phast,PHAST Timing Board Fundraiser,"Hello PHAST Families and Extended Friends and Family. Many of us were blown away this past summer by the awesome timing board at Rancho San Miguel. This inspired a few us to look into the logistics of getting a similar timing board at our pool. The new timing board we would like to purchase will list the times by lanes 1-6 all at once . This new board would be wheeled out to the side of the pool and set up next to the announcer so that the swimmers can finish a race and immediately look over and see their time. We also plan to leave our original timing board on the roof of the pool house so parents and the away team can see times displayed there. All of this amazing technology comes at a cost that we are asking you all to help with. The cost for the new board and related equipment is approximately $7,500. We have already been able to raise around $1,800 from the the 2016 swim a thon.  We would like to be able to raise the funds needed to have this board in place by the start of the 2017 swim season. Many of you were excited to hear about the possibility of this happening last season.

In those 20 years he was blessed to get a kidney transplant in 1998, this kidney lasted him till roughly 2012.  At that time he went back on dialysis.  Since then he has had numerous cardiac issues, needing multiple cardiac procedures. He has over come so many hurdles, and fought so many battles to stay alive. November 26th 2016, he was sent home on a Intravenous Dopamine infusion and was told by the outstanding doctors at his favorite hospital Cedars-Siani, that there was ""nothing more they could do for him"". They encouraged him to go home and spend what ever remaining time he has left with his family. He decided to be placed on hospice on December 16th 2016.  This past week has been a struggle for him, he has even said ""its getting harder and harder to reach his goals"" and he realizes him dieing is ""going to happen"". His last days are very soon.  One of the things he has been worried about is how my mom, financially was going to be able to survive. They do not have life insurance.  Anyone who deals with a family member that has a chronic illness knows its next to impossible to get life insurance.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/cure-for-danons-disease,Cure for Danon Disease,"￼          My name is Joseph Schoedel I am 19 years old, and I'm from Long Island, NY. The reason why I'm creating this campaign today is that I want to raise awareness for finding a cure for Danon disease.                      My story on how I got Danon's disease.  As I was participating in gym class playing a basketball game. I felt a slight palpitation in my chest so I felt the need of having to go to the school nurse to get a  listen to my chest just to be cautious. The school nurse listened, and what she heard was described a heart murmur which is basically an abnormal heartbeat that sounds like a swishing sound.   So, it was recommended for me to get checked out at my regular pediatrician. My doctor took a listen. The same exact sound was spotted. From there I had to schedule an appointment with a pediatric cardiologist to get some tests done. These tests would indicate whether or not there was something going on with my heart.  Obviously, the results came up positive. The cardiologist diagnosed me with something called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. What this does to your heart is it makes it hard for the heart to pump blood efficiently through the bloodstream because of how thick the heart muscle is. Normally with this diagnosis, your heart is up to three times the size of a normal size heart. This also causes shortness of breath, chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythms. There was no cure for it and they still haven’t found one to this day. The alternative treatments that were available to me included an implantable pacemaker/defibrillator. Which would protect you from dangerous heart episodes from occurring. The second option for an alternative treatment would be a medication called beta blockers to slow down or regulate the heart rate.       The next step in my journey was, it was highly recommended that I had to get pacemaker/defibrillator. The surgery was done at the Long Island Jewish Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park. Dr. Andrew Blaufox was my pediatric electrophysiologist at the time. Dr. Blaufox was also the surgeon that performed the operation on me that implanted the device into my chest. It was very painful and energy draining going through the process of getting it done. After having that surgery I was hurting on one side of my body for about three weeks because the scar that was bandaged up had to heal which made me very sore and deal with a lot of pain. The pros and cons though of having this device. The pros you know you are protected and you will be safe. The cons is if your heart goes beyond a certain rate the device detects it and the pacemaker will automatically shock you instantly. What that feels like is basically is either a hard punch to the chest or if somebody kicks you with a soccer ball super hard. I’ve gotten shocked twice in the span of 5 min in my life. The reason why that happened was in 2016 I was participating in a school volleyball tournament. I wasn’t watching how competitive I was getting. It got to the point where the pacemaker was tricked by physical activity and the device thought there was dangerous heart rhythm activity happening. I did have to go to the emergency room that night but everything ended up okay at the end after my heart doctor told me it wasn’t a dangerous situation. Two years later, I was 17 years old. I switched from LIJH to one of the best hospitals in the United States, NYU Langone Medical Center in NYC. I was admitted into the Heart and Rhythm Center department that specifically focused on what I was diagnosed with, which was (HCM).  My doctor was named Steven Fowler. He discovered the second diagnosis that I was diagnosed called Danon disease. Danon Disease is a rare genetic condition that causes muscle weakness, heart disease, and learning problems. This disease was caused by genetic mutations which could be only inherited from the mother. Males with Danon's disease usually develop the condition earlier than females and are more severely affected. In most cases, you need a heart transplant because of how severe the disease especially with males. Normally the affected males, on average, live to age 19, while affected females live to an average age of 34.    The first step on how Dr. Fowler discovered Danon disease was he had to inject glucose into my veins that also had radiation in it. I had to be in a room by myself for this procedure because it was dangerous for other people to be around me with high radiation running through my body in the situation. What the radiation basically did was it would send out a signal to show where the glucose would end up.      The second part of finding out the diagnosis was putting me in an MRI machine to detect where the radiation was to detect the glucose whether it set in any of my muscles. The results came up positive at the end. Danon disease was very rare at the time and I was one out of 500 people that had it in the whole world. Since then it seems that there have been more cases of it being discovered from 15,000 people and on.   My disease affects me mentally and physically in my life to this day. I’m very limited being active daily because of how careful I have to be with my heart. This would mean so much to me if this campaign was successful. This is also not just for me it's for all the people around the world that have this life-threatening disease. All proceeds will go to organizations specializing in finding a cure for Danon disease. Also, it will go towards for families that are affected by Danon's disease that are in need of financing for travel to hospitals. I would be thankful if everybody donated and supported this awareness.If you would like to read more about this I provided a link down below:      https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/danon-disease/",https://images.gofundme.com/6k47jb1IdrFxW0Ew3gt1jAXeRoQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17151634_1556901465124165_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Joseph Schoedel is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,180 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/yf-family-help-fund,Family Help Fund,"Dear family and friends, I am reaching out to you on the behalf of myself and our family to ask for your help in our time of need.  As many of you know, our lives were rocked by tragedy on October 25th of 2015 when Abby had her car accident and we lost an amazing young man and friend, Alex Mundt.  We have been slowly trying to recuperate (if that is even possible) and put the pieces back together.  We have been overwhelmed throughout this entire process by the love and support that our family, friends, local lacrosse community, and the Myers Park community have provided us.  For this reason, the following request seems unfair and is an incredibly difficulty thing for us to request, but are out of options.  Except for serving the remainder of her probation, Abby’s criminal legal battle is pretty much behind us.  But the civil battle remains with Alex’s family.  In an effort to avoid a civil lawsuit, we have settled with Alex’s family.  This obviously has placed a great financial burden upon us, and we have utilized money that we had been saving for years.   In addition to the legal fees from both the criminal and civil cases, we are also faced with medical bills from the accident, as well as Nick’s recent knee surgery.  The second portion of an established payment is due to Alex’s family in February.  The first payment was made in November.  We are establishing a Go Fund Me for this purpose.  We understand that the holidays are a financially stressful time of year for many, and thus it makes this an even harder request for us to make.  But every little bit will truly make a difference for us.  And if you feel you can not help financially, then we just ask that you will prayer that the Great Provider will see us through this tribulation as he has guided us through the last 14 months.   We have kept silent on the financial toll it has taken on our family until now when it has gotten beyond what we could ever hope to handle on our own.  We know that we can never repay any of you for your kindness, but hope you know that if you ever need anything from us that we will assist in any way in which we are able.  If you want to speak to either Kristen or myself directly, please feel free to do so.",https://images.gofundme.com/hLG6r3irvD-6gIpvqxdcA1t6ilY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17151894_fb_1483405454.7361_funds.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Joseph McGaha is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"$5,248 raised of $75,000 goal"

I wanted to begin a fund for Andrzej as his beautiful and humble family touched my heart. In August, Andrzej suffered severe injuries to his back after a work accident in Poland.  He was hit from the back by an excavator bucket. Currently, he is under intensive care and therapy in Krakow, Poland. Andrzej is paralyzed from the waist down but it is unknown at this time if this will be permanent.However, we see progress with continued rehabilitation which will continue until January. After this period, the family will take over the financial responsibility as the insurance will discontinue the coverage. This will be an extremely impossible task as Andrzej was the sole family provider.  As a result, I wanted to help this family raise money to cover the extensive medical bills. The Tkaczyk family has always been there for any of us in need and it will mean so much to be able to be there for them.Please pray for Andrzej and his family.   Donations will be used for any medical expenses during Andrzej's long road to recovery. His dream is to heal and be there for his two children and his wife. Thank you so much for your donation. Cześć, mam na imię Ewa Paleń i jestem drogim przyjacielem rodziny Tkaczyk.

Andrzej jest sparaliżowany od pasa w dół, ale nie wiadomo w tej chwili, czy to będzie trwałe.Jednak widzimy postęp w ciągłej rehabilitacji, która potrwa do stycznia. Po tym okresie, rodzina przejmie odpowiedzialność finansową ponieważ pokrycie ubezpieczeniowe będzie wyczerpane. Będzie to niezwykle niemożliwe, gdyż Andrzej był jedyna osoba utrzymująca rodzinę. W związku z tym chciałam pomóc  rodzinie pokryć rachunki medyczne.Rodzina Tkaczyk zawsze była tam dla każdego z nas w potrzebie a wiec możemy być tam dla nich także.Módlcie się za Andrzeja i jego rodzinę.

They fixed her up and we went on our happy way. She kept limping and holding her paw up. And it got worse. X-rays and CT scans confirmed that she has congenital abnormalities in her elbows. In one, there's a free-floating bone in her elbow joint (fragmented medial coronoid). The left remains in place but will cause big problems later in the way of pain and inflammation from degenerative arthritis. We need to correct the right leg right away (can't wait per the surgeon) and lessen and prolong the pain in the left.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/dee-thye-medical-fund,Dee Thye Medical Fund,"Medical Fund for Dee ThyeIn 2007, Dee found a small lump in her right armpit, a daunting discovery for anyone, especially a woman. She had the lump biopsied but the results came back inconclusive so insurance wouldn't cover its removal. The mass began to grow in size, causing pain and discomfort that eventually rendered her unable to work. She revisited doctors through the years and had the mass biopsied 5 more times with the same inconclusive results.  Finally. in August of 2016, the mass was so large it wrapped around from her shoulder blade to her collar bone and reached all the way to her sternum. Because of the tremendous size of the tumor and the fact that it had wraped around multiple ribs and arteries, she was finally able to find a doctor willing to operate. The surgery took two hours and two specialists to remove the large mass, roughly the size of a softball.  Even after removal, the specialists were unsure of the nature of the mass and sent a sample to Boston to be analyzed. In September of 2016, her family received the heart-sinking news that the tumor was a very rare form of cancer known as Fibrosarcoma (fewer than 500 people diagnosed annually in the U.S.). Due to the tremendous costs of two specialist surgeons, multiple consultations, bone scans, CAT scans, etc. we are seeking any help to assist the family. Unfortunately, though she and her husband had insurance, it did not cover any of the cost of surgery, hospitalization, radiation, or Chemo. Their share of the premium is $390.00 a month, and non-covered portions of the bills have already surpassed $50,000. We are starting this page to help a woman whose character is second to none. She is a mother, grandmother, daughter, wife, and beloved friend to so many. Her smile can light up an entire room and her love and generosity know no bounds. Any contribution will be used to pay for some of these medical expenses and will be appreciated beyond measure. Each and every contribution will mean the world to this family and will be returned with prayer and blessing.

The thought of these babies with nothing on these cold, rainy nights keeps us up crying at night.We are part of Helping Pawz, Inc a 501c3. So your donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE. If you want to make sure we get your entire donation please feel free to donate through paypal, just ask us for the email address. #GoFundMeThere are literally 100's of chained dogs that have nothing, not even a dog house to keep them out of the elements. It is now getting so so cold and some these sweet dogs only have measley shelter to protect them from the cold. More than not have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. There are 1000's of cats that are strays and have nothing as well. We are trying to break the cycle and get as many fixed as possible, as well as bring them food and a soft place to lay their heads. It breaks our hearts every time to go out here but we keep doing it for the poor souls that need us. We had so much success fixing SO MANY animals the last few trips, we want to keep it up! Our main focus in the winter is bringing warmth, shelter, and food. We are going January 29th to pass out hay and cedar for the bitter cold months, as much food as possible, and to get as many signed up to be fixed as possible. We are desperate to get as many animals hay, cedar, and food as possible as well as get them fixed. We will always take donations of cedar, food, prevents, toys, and Home Depot gift cards. The only way we will be able to stop this vicious cycle of unwanted animals is if we get as many cats and dogs fixed as possible as well. We want to get as much hay and cedar chips as possible to keep these sweeties warm!The thought of these babies without anything warm to sleep on or food to fill their bellies keeps us up at night, we can't stop thinking about them when we are snug in our beds in the cold rainy nights. We wish we could take them all inside, but we want to do as much as possible for them. We know they will have nothing to lay on but the hard ground. They will have run out of food that we brought them last trip and will be eating scraps again. It is absolutely heartbreaking. They will not get warmth, vetted, food, love, or toys if we do not bring them some. Our hearts ache for these poor babies every time we go. We hope to one day change the laws and change the ways of the younger generation, but for now we can only help any way we can. We are always desperate for volunteers and could always use as much help as we can get. We need funds to keep fixing as many animals as possible, we have a list of animals on the ""wait list"" but need to stop them from reproducing. Every dollar that we raise, we will use for these poor animals. How much we can do, depends on what we raise. We are always so appreciative of every single dollar that you donate. You just don't know the GOOD you are doing for these poor animals. Each time we go, we really try to educate this community on proper animal care and how they can help themselves.

At 58, she is ineligible to receive her husband's Social Security benefits until mid 2019, and although previously  pronounced disabled by the state of TN, she has never drawn  SSI benefits , thus must reapply-- a process that could take 3-6 months and possibly longer. She has no local family  able to assist with financial needs or housing. In short, she is at risk of homelessness.In addition to coping with grief and learning to live without her husband, Donna battles multiple chronic, debilitating medical conditions that make working outside the home impossible.  Her late husband was the couple's primary breadwinner,  thus she is now faced with the task of finding a way to support herself while awaiting Social Security benefits determination. Temporary financial assistance  from GoFundMe donations will help Donna to pay for food,  rent, utility  medical bills  and much-needed medicines while she  grieves, heals,   and learns to live independently. Although she is unable to maintain employment outside the home, Donna is working hard to  support herself through her artwork, landscapes, still life, and  personalized portraits  of people and pets. (For info, private message her on  Donna's Facebook Page . Contrary to general opinion, portrait artists able to make a living selling their work are the exception rather than the rule.  The cliche, ""starving artist"" is a cliche for a reason. Nonetheless, here are a few samples of her work, should you wish to commission an art piece. ""Sissy & Haley"" 14 x 17  ""Caleb Sleeping"" Faber-Castell graphite pencil, 14x17 on Bristol vellum Ultimately, your donations, will help Donna to  pay  for rent, utilities, medical bills, prescrptions, car insurance , and even the most basic needs (like soap, cat food, and laundry detergent) while she  waits for Social Security Survivor Benefits and works on establishing  a means for self-support. She wishes to extend her most sincere gratitude towards each one of you who encourages, prays and donates towards helping her through this dark time in her life.  Thank you for taking time to read her story and to repost this link on your social media feeds.",https://images.gofundme.com/2KoOPVPW2rPApoijlztBZLZTevA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17152442_1504738746.9887.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17152442_1483425034.8977_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17152442_1483425054.5329_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17152442_1483425075.6065_funddescription.jpg']",3,"Created January 2, 2017",Donna Thorne is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$7,893 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/luccas-surgery,Lucca's Surgery,"LUCCA NEEDS HELPDearest friends,Those who know Collin, know that he is not good at asking for help, unless it's for a true emergency. On December 31st, 2016, Lucca had a very bad accident. In the snow storm, a good friend was trying visit Lucca & Collin. Unfortunately, that person's vehicle got stuck about 5 miles from anyone. She called, Lucca & Collin went to help. Collin was driving an old, 1983, Honda 3-wheeler, because he has no other transportation. Lucca ran over hills, through snow, and through the freezing temperatures, 'til she came to a large washed out, muddy pond-type area. With hesitation, she jumped onto the 3-wheeler & they started across. Lucca was startled by the waves of water & jumped off. She landed on the ice awkwardly, & tore her back leg apart, at the lower joint. Freeing the stuck vehicle, she was then rushed to the ""Veterinary Emergency & Specialty Center of Northern Arizona"". After several hours, & lots of excruciating pain, Collin was told that she can only be helped by a surgeon, an orthopedic specialist, in Phoenix, Arizona. This surgeon is the only one (they're aware of) qualified to fix her leg. If not fixed, she'll be in excruciating pain, for the remainder of her life, & she CANNOT continue to be his service dog (or anyone's). The doctor assured Collin, if she gets this help, she'll live a full & happy life, AND continue her service career. If you're reading this, you may have already met Lucca, & know of her total loving, warm personality - the light & the smiles she brings to a room of darkness. She is loved, not just by Collin but by all that she touches. Lucca is Collin's, doctor prescribed, service dog. She has twice alerted him BEFORE a kidney attack, actually allowing him to get some help BEFORE THE BRUNT OF THE ATTACK. She has training in PTSD, K9, & in generalized service dog work. But, she is so much more than just his service dog. She is his constant companion, his strength, HIS light.You see, three years ago, Collin found out that he had a highly aggressive, terminal disease. He was informed that no known cure or treatment could be done to prevent or prolong his life. On top of his PTSD,from the Marine Corps (He served our country 2 times as a Marine and once in the Army). He soon found himself homeless, jobless, penniless, & in a very dark place. The Marine Corps even dropped (ie LOST) his records & he was virtually alone & without hope. Thanks to loved ones, Lucca came into his life & ""she is the most persistent & positive gift I have ever had."" She allowed/demanded him to re-enter society with confidence, security, & even hope.Lucca does not allow anyone to be sad or unhappy. Thanks to Lucca, Collin has met some of the most warm-hearted, loving, & caring people. These people -  friends & family - have all been working close & diligently under Lucca's watchful eye, to KEEP HIM ALIVE, EVERY DAY.Let me be clear - Collin has NO money, NO working vehicle, & NO INCOME, or any other means of getting the necessary funds to provide the treatment that Lucca desperately needs. Collin has been fighting for nearly 12 years to get the government to pay him the funds they readily admit they owe him but for some reason, it never gets done correctly. It gets ""lost"" or is changed by a clerk somewhere & every year, he has to begin again. Just to try to collect on the funds he has coming! (This is our govt !!! How they treat many veterans is despicable)He is also still waiting for his social security disability & VA disability!!! He is attempting to work with a law group but has no idea how long that will take.  To quote Collin, ""I may be long gone when it actually happens."" One hell of a fight to get assistance due and admittedly OWED! Please help them both - Get LUCCA the surgery she must have to continue doing the most respectable job she can have - Collin's Service Dog. She needs this surgery immediately.  Please share, please donate, EVERY DOLLAR makes a difference. IF you are inclined to help Collin in any way AT ALL this would be the first thing he truly needs - he deserves SO MUCH MORE. Anything above and beyond the vet bills will go to help Collin get a vehicle and anything else he deserves to have as a HUMAN BEING and as a DEFENDER OF OUR BLESSED FREEDOM! IF ANYONE in my tribe deserves anything - it is Collin... he is a blessing, a person I will always consider a brother and someone for whom I have much respect.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-little-help-for-bridget,A little help for Bridget :),"Hey everyone!  I have started a page to support my dear friend Bridget Burke.  Many people don't know what she has been dealing with because she has been so sick and often not able to leave the house. I'll try my best to give a brief synopsis of what this lady has endured over the last two and a half years and the immense need to get her to a pay for service clinic in Toronto for a possible diagnosis.    Approximately two years ago, Bridget began suffering from migraine like headaches, and swollen lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are found all over your body, they are an integral component of our lymphatic system which is responsible for providing support to the immune system.  She was hospitalized in Sault Ste. Marie several times, and even spent some of her time in the ICU, but never received a diagnosis.  Due to the lack of a diagnosis, the doctors were only to treat the symptoms.  They began with antibiotics and steroids, this was to try and help reduce the swelling of the lymph nodes. They also tried Humira and other immune suppressing medications, but unfortunately this treatment did not work.    She was referred to a Rheumatologist in Newmarket, and again, no diagnosis was made.  It was back to the drawing board.  Returning to the Sault, a surgeon was consulted, and decide to surgically remove some of the swollen lymph nodes, as the medication treatment was not helping.  She had lymph nodes removed from her neck, groin and ankles.  Onto more immunosuppresants medication, and hospital admissions for pneumonia and sepsis.     With all of the steroids and immune suppressing medication, a new complication arose, a dead bone in her heel.  It sounds as awful as it is painful.  More antibiotics to try and deal with the swelling lymph nodes but still no diagnosis.  Unfortunately, as aforementioned, without a diagnosis there is no way to ultimately treat the root cause of the illness.  A referral to Toronto General Hospital came through, bone marrow aspiration and other tests were completed, still no diagnosis.   Apart from the obvious stress of being sick with no known reason why, there has also been the loss of income and quality of life.  Bridget's amazing fiancé, oRandy Swanson, has been working as much as he possibly can to support his family.  Unfortunately, there are only so many hours in a day.  They need some help to get Bridget the care that she desperately needs and so deserves.    This is where we come in.  Bridget has a referral to the Lockwood Clinic in Toronto.  This clinic is funded by OHIP,  although some tests are not covered.  She has not been able to work for over two years, and living on disability barely covers the cost of daily living.  Let's help get Bridget to this clinic and get her a diagnosis so she can be treated!!!  It's time to get this lady some quality of life back :)",https://images.gofundme.com/40v6DR3b6N1hYXfJxhBv_78d9Ss=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17152648_1483407581.4211.jpg,[],0,"Created May 8, 2017",Jessica Eileen is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Bridget Burke.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$10,845 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-kirkpatricklangworthy-family,The Kirkpatrick-Langworthy Family,"Hello everyone! As many of you know, Haleigh and Marc have been seeking medical care for Nash since he was two months old. A large head circumference and vomiting were chief complaints; however, continued testing revealed no abnormalities at the time, and Haleigh and Marc were continually sent home to monitor his symptoms. Since then, Haleigh and Marc have continued to advocate and fight for Nash's best interests as they knew deep in their hearts that something was wrong. At Nash's four month appointment, Haleigh's  and Marc's pediatrician noted Nash's increasing head circumference and once again sent them to a local hospital for further testing. Further testing revealed that Nash had a Subdural Hematoma. In order to drain fluid from his brain to his belly, Nash underwent surgery where a shunt was placed. Thankfully, Nash is rapidly improving and his head circumference has already decreased as pressure has been released. However, Nash may have the shunt for up to a year and will need continued medical care and physical therapy to help him continue to reach milestones that were more difficult to reach due to his health issues. As many of you can empathize, Haleigh and Marc will have an incredible financial burden to bare as they continue to advocate for health and healing in 2017. As her friends, we've set up this fundraising page to help them focus on the care of their family, rather than the potential debt that many arise.

Every little bit counts!For the last seven years, the Eldert Street Community garden has been providing the surrounding neighborhood with one of its only green spaces and community outlets. It has been maintained entirely by volunteers and by charitable donations from community members, nonprofit organizations, and local elected officials. We now wish to reach out to as broad a group as possible, because we need more help than we ever have before.Namely, the garden is in jeopardy because of an attempt by someone from an outside organization to unlawfully sell it to a third party. The garden has been operating entirely legally and with the cooperation of its neighbors for seven years and is now facing difficulty through no fault of its members. We are fully confident that we can prevent this injustice, but it will require great effort on our part, and on our attorney’s. This being the case, we have incurred unexpected expenses that have far exceeded our usual annual budget.And so, we are asking for donations from our community and everyone who is concerned with neighborhoods and community resources being co-opted by real estate developers. Anything and everything you can contribute will be immensely appreciated.

One man that has dedicated my time to the pursuit of knowledge and helping other cancer patients if they so desire. My path my seem unorthodox to many but I choose to go my own way. What was once the worst news of my life is now becoming a challenge to be destroyed. I'm WINNING and have the evidence to prove it, but need all the help I can muster as the NHS will not help me. I am spreading the word and some positivity to others in need. My aim is to finish healing, then use my fund to invest into equipment and supplies so that I can help others at a much greater rate, no matter which direction they choose for their own health. I offer this alongside my knowledge to help others LIVE with cancer.I have been making an impact on people's lives already without any financial power and have depended on unwavering support and donations from people that believe in me. I am now at the point were I must purchase my own equipment and build my own team to help bring some form of support for those thrown out in the cold when there are no options left for them. I highly appreciate any support and any help achieving my mission. Thank you so much to all that have supported me so far. My rough budget is broken down below: 20-25 grand for my own self healing - this equals 2 years worth of £1000 a month wages. (24k) The rest of the 75-80k shall be invested into supplies and electro medicine equipment to help any other cancer patient who requests it. An example of some of the more expensive equipment I could obtain: BEMER mat - £6000-8000Hyperbaric Oxygen chamber - £6000-9000 (depending on specs) Kitchen equipment set up for a clinic - £15000 (Large juicers, oven, double sized fridge to store organic produce, etcMy story: I'm 21 years old currently battling cancer for the second time in my life. At age 17 I was suffering from deep chest pains stemming from a large lump under my collar bone. After a trip to the doctors, I was misdiagnosed with Costochondritis (inflamed rib cartilage) then sent home. I returned a few months later as my condition saw no improvement and had only worsened overtime to be told I had stage 2 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma blood cancer. This was just one month after my 18th birthday - the news completely shell shocked me and devastated my family .After a few weeks of hell waiting for scan results and tests, a huge needle jammed into my hipbone and surgery on my neck,  I eventually began 6 months of intensive chemotherapy. After the end of it all, I had finally went into remission. I was so grateful to be alive and leave the hospital on the final day and not have to suffer from any more of the heavy side effects or vomiting from chemo. I remember being in such a state that a wheelchair was being sent for me because they didn't think I could walk during the sickness, but I just stood up and walked straight out the hospital for what I thought was the final time. However this only lasted for just under two years. Some symptoms like tiredness and brain function took a long time to return to normal but my health eventually started to deteriorate again. My energy levels were so low, my immune system was failing, leaving me at the mercy of most colds/infections, I was having heavy drenching night sweats then began to lose 2 stone in weight very rapidly as the disease developed a bigger grip on my body. I knew it was back.I was taken into hospital in an ambulance due to servere chest pain.After more scans and a chest biopsy, (another huge needle put straight into my chest) I was re-diagnosed in November 2015 with a much more aggressive Hodgkin's Lymphoma stage 3B advanced cancer. which has spread to my stomach in multiple areas as well as both sides of my chest and neck. The largest tumour in my chest between 3-4 inches grew back in the original place from when I first had cancer…it never went away. It was at this point I accepted that I was dying and I needed to do something about it FAST to save myself. I was told to start treatment immediately because the largest tumour would begin to push against my lungs and heart within the next 4 weeks over christmas. After already having chemotherapy in the past, I decided it wasn't for me and chose to try something new because it had made me so sick previously. The definition of madness is to try the same thing over and over then expect a different result. The doctors didn't like this one bit and would offer me no other treatment options other than chemotherapy - which is proven not to work for me. I was told without chemotherapy I would be dead within 8 months…yet here I am! So the NHS cannot help me in anyway, I must look further afield. Looking back, the surgery & chemotherapy aggravated the cancer, it only bought me time.ImprovementSince November/December 2015 I have made a remarkable improvement and recovery through a complete lifestyle change and treatment options not yet available on the NHS. Scan results in February confirmed that what I'm doing is working!!!To maximise my chances of survival, I have completely changed my lifestyle and diet which involves drinking lots of fresh Organic juice/smoothies, raw food filled with live enzymes and expensive supplements that have proven to work. All toxins have been removed from my life.The problem is, all the costs of my medicines and the intensive regime are very expensive, including the additional costs for private scans, checkups, blood tests and transport. - the NHS will not help! The worse part is, the money needed is nowhere near as expensive as the costs of chemotherapy that they would happily pay to use yet refusing any alternative.My latest scan results show an overall reduction in tumour activity and some decrease in size but I am not quite finished yet with being an advanced patient. I currently await the latest scan results. Those closest to me want nothing more than for me to be cancer free once again so that I can live a normal life. The treatments I receive are NOT available on the NHS so I must rely on myself and other peoples generosity to survive. PLEASE DONATE WHAT YOU CAN, IF YOU CAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!Over £8000 has been raised offline and on just giving so far. However these funds have been used over the past year to save my life which I am extremely grateful for. I have used the last of my funds up so I have now decided to switch to go fund me as I saw other people having greater success on their website compared to just giving. I don't ever expect to reach the 100k number but its worth a shot - others on go fund me have done so, so I can! Anything that will keep me sustained and to help others in the same situation. I have already begun to help some people who also have cancer but thats quite hard to do if you still need to fix yourself first.

I'm a proud American Muslim and a member of an immigrant family that has it pretty easy. As incredibly priveledged people, we can sometimes be awfully ungrateful. A bed to sleep in and a mother to cry to is a blessing, not a God-given right... The only God-given right we possess is to be treated with decency. The Al-Refai family is a Syrian refugee family who's home was destroyed by bombs. I signed up a few months ago with Georgian for Syrian refugees, an organization that aids the refugees coming into Georgia by teaching them English (they speak Arabic) and also helping them adapt to US culture. The Al-Refai family was my assigned family, but I became more than just their teacher. They welcome me in their home as family. They have witnessed unspeakable tragedies, including losing their own family members. The family consists of the father Mohommad, his wife Heba (suffers from breast cancer), 16 yr old daughter Rama, 30 yr old son Ali, his wife Ayat, and their two children, Elaine and Hibah. This is an intelligent family that is poor because of their misfortune but rich at heart. They are now here, with an insufficent amount of money for basic things, such as clothes and groceries. They barely speak English, but they do whatever they can for my family and i as a thank you for helping. They teach me that sometimes the people with the very least have the most to give. They make me feel ashamed that I have complained about my own minuscule issues. I want to show people that have witnessed inhumanity that humanity still exists. I want to raise money to surprise them with a car. Even if it's 1$, please help me. I believe that service to others is the rent we pay for our room here on Earth. Good deeds never go unnoticed.I will be the person withdrawing the money that is donating, and it will be withdrawn from my personal bank account. I will also be the singular person purchasing the car. The Riaz family (Farzana Ali and Humza Riaz) have agreed to sell me their used car if I am to raise the goal of 3,500$. My family and I will go to the Riaz's home to purchase the car and we will surprise the Al-Refai family together by bringing it to their house.",https://images.gofundme.com/gzy6DBIMPG_f1Urog1-b5ispRQc=/960x960/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17153066_14861896560_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Maham Husain is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Maham Husain.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$3,700 raised of $3,700 goal"

A good friend of mine, Dominic D'Andrea and his family, lost everything they've ever owned due to an electrical fire in their home just after Christmas. Deemed a total loss, nothing in their home was salvagable. Everyone is safe though, which is, by far the most important part. As I said before, I am a musician, and that is how I came to know Dominic & his family. He's a great person from a great family & he is a phenominal pianst/ songwriter. As you can see from the photograph, he no longer has an instrument to practice, or perform with. If you're an artist, I'm sure you all know how devastating losing equipment for our trades can be, especially those pieces that hold sentiment. Our instruments, whether musical or not, all allow us expression, of joy, sorrow, love, & pain. Sometimes it's the only way we can communicate our thoughts or feelings. The money we raise in this campaign will be to allow Dominic to purchase a replacement touring keyboard, the tool of his trade. The Roland FA-08 88 Key Workstation is what we are looking to replace along with a touring case to keep it in tact.  Music has kept me together through some of the hardest moments in my life. I hope you can all find it in your heart to give, so we may get Dominic back out there doing what he loves, making people smile, and inspiring people, as he has inspired me.

Although only 51 years old, Sylvia touched every heart that crossed her. With not much to give, Sylvia wouldn't hesitate to lend any help she could to anyone.

It is unfortunate that without the help of all of our family and friends, Sylvia's family won't be able to give her the proper goodbye that every person deserves to have when they're leaving behind someone dear to them.

Since then, they have adjusted to a single income while Christie cares for her at home. In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, Bob started feeling sick. He assumed it was a cold or flu, based on the symptoms (and the weather fluctuation here in Texas). The day after Thanksgiving he decided to make a trip to Memorial Hermann in Humble, as he became worrisome with his persistant breathing issues and symptoms continuing. He spent two weeks there, where they treated him for pnuemonia, but soon realized that there were spots in his lungs that needed to be scanned. In doing different scans and MRIs, they soon located a mass on his colon as well. They decided that separate biopsies and a colonoscopy were to be in order ASAP. The problem at this point, was they could not perform the biopsies on the lungs as he was still having trouble breathing and they believed he had an infection in the lung(s). So they performed a colonoscopy, which came back to be benign (originally). Bob was then sent home from Memorial Hermann with a few prescriptions and told to report back in a timely fashion in order to get the biopsies on his lungs.A week after being home, Bob was having difficulthy breathing and continued chest pains. He went back to Memorial Hermann in Humble, only to be turned away, so Christie took him to LBJ hospital in Houston. They performed the lung biopsies, and the first one came back clear. It was the second one where they noticed the malign mass, a metastacized cancerous tumour, just days before Christmas. Upon doing so, they were planning to begin the chemotherapy treatments until they found a small infection which had to be treated before undergoing the chemo.  Finally, on Friday, December 30th, they began the first cycle of chemo which continued throughout the following Sunday morning. He finished just this past weekend (Sunday 1/1).Currently, he is still in LBJ hospital, and expected to be able to return home, however he will not be able to work due to his condition. He will have a nurse to come to his home once a week, but will have consisten oxygen and antibiotics intravenously. The following chemo treatments are still to be determined, as it is a matter of how his body accepts and tolerates the first cycle. In this last 6+ weeks, Bob has not been able to work as usual, and in not doing so, is not able to provide the income his family depends on. The rent and bills alone are piling up - but aside from this, the fuel for the vehicle while Christie traveled daily to be with Bob at the hospital and then at home with Anneliese, is much more than anyone could budget for even with a steady income. The family is in critical need of financial assistance while they go through this time, especially since they have an 18 month old child and now no income. They are quickly falling behind while looking at what is to come: the hospital and treatment/prescription costs are unbelievably expensive, let alone what everything else continues to cost with no income flowing in. If Christie is able to find a job, she will still have to pay childcare costs and at the moment, will need to be at Bob's side while he is at home in between treatments. It is a very unexpected situation, as I am sure none of us can fathom going through. However, they have no choice but to do this for Bob's health and longevity. Please share this page if that's all you can do. But if you have anything to donate or bless them with, it is greatly needed and much appreciated. Your prayers are also coveted while they continue to undergo some difficult times in a long road to recovery. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I will post updates as this journey continues. Please share! And thank you, personally, from me. Bob is an amazing man who showed me kindness and love when he didn't have to. My family appreciates his presence in our lives and we are steadily praying for healing.",https://images.gofundme.com/-Fw0_YJJ6pOAdM-ztXx6WPM7DGY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17153644_1483410212.0334.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Robert Smith is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Christie Tucker.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,790 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/sean-steiners-medical-fund,Sean Steiner's Medical Fund,"Dear family and friends,I would like to tell a story that many of you are familiar with but may not know or understand the details.  Over the past 2 1/2 years I have been touched by the strength, patience and perseverance that one young man has shown, my nephew Sean Steiner.In July of 2014 Sean was hiking during a family reunion event when he sustained a serious injury to his leg.  He broke his tibia and fibula in a compound fracture that filled up with dirt as he slid down a ravine about five feet.  Pulling him out and carrying him up the trail to rescue workers was traumatic but not near as traumatic as what was to come from endless failed attempts to heal his leg over the next few years.During Sean's first surgery a rod from his knee to his ankle was placed to line up the bone.  The doctor expected recovery time of 4-6 months.  However, after 3 months it was apparent that things were taking a turn for the worse.  Sean saw several doctors over a period of time, some of which refused to take on his case.  In December 2014 he was admitted to the hospital to have the rod removed and replaced with one laced with antibiotics.  His infection was so serious that it was necessary to remove the dying tissue leaving an inch and half of bone exposed.  A vacuum pump was used to help the opening to close and direct the healing tissue to cover the area.  If the bone was left exposed too long it would die.   Sean was very optimistic after this procedure.  All was going well until another infection appeared, this one having three different cultures, making it worse than the first.Another sugery followed that involved a tissue transplant and insertion of a pic line under Sean's arm that would allow direct injections of antibiotics every eight hours.  Again, Sean had renewed hope and faith in this procedure, remaining positive through out the ordeal.At the beginning of 2015 the infection returned baffling doctors and medical staff.  The rod was removed and replaced with a boot manufactured to his leg giving Sean enough stability that he could walk with a cane.  After three months, it was evident that his bone was still not healing and he was referred to a specialist.  However, due to insurance issues it would be several months before Sean would actually be seen.During the summer of 2016 while working with his church to help the homeless, Sean felt a crack and a tremendous amount of pain.  He was taken to emergency to learn that his fibula had broken again and the tibia still had not healed.  Gristle and scar tissue had given a false sense of stability only leading to another set back.  Sean had done some research into a doctor in Scottsdale who is known for revolutionary procedures.  This doctor determined that part of Sean's bone had died which was a breeding ground for bacteria.  He would need to remove the infected bone and break the healthy  bone above.  A special frame of pins, rings, and adjustable struts would be attached to the healthy bone allowing it to be stretched over time while it healed, eventually closing the gap where the dead bone was removed.This procedure resulted in several more surgeries and extremely painful sessions of traction as the bone moved 1 mm per day over the next two and half months.  During this time new infections occurred causing more complications.  Sean had to have several more pic lines inserted trying different antibiotics, for his body developed alergies to the previous ones that had worked.  Sean was hospitalized again in December 2016 with a new infection facing the reality of amputation.  After another surgery it was determined that the bone had not been infected but healed enough that some of the rings and pins could be removed.  Although his road to complete recovery is still long and unpredictable this was very good news.Sean has been using a medical device called a Bemer that has not yet been approved by his insurance company.  He was able to borrow one from a patient but had to give it back.  This devise applies specially designed electromagnetic impulses, called Pulsed Electro-Magnetic Therapy, the cells can produce more energy and the metabolism is activated.  Disturbed control systems function again, and the self-healing powers are supported.  Sean believes that this devise was instrumental to his recent progress and would like to be able to continue his therapy.Our goal is to raise $10,000.00.  This would be enough money to purchase the $5,000.00 devise and help pay off some lingering medical bills.  I know that there are many good causes, and it would be impossible to donate to them all.  If at this time you are unable to help financially, please remember Sean in your prayers.  Together with the help of our Heavenly Father, we can make a difference.",https://images.gofundme.com/h3UwH6HVH-iWZVDAMbS4v-1hpHQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17153748_1483410939.8618.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Judy Haltinner Steiner

https://www.gofundme.com/f/fair-haven-eric-gonzalez-jr,"Fair Haven's, Eric Gonzalez jr","On Christmas Day, four year old Eric Gonzalez Jr. of Fair Haven CT was killed. His single mother, 25 year old Yokasta Cortorreal, has been dealt this unimaginable tragedy of losing her only child.  Henderson's Funeral Home in Springfield MA (where the family has relatives) has put together a tremendous service at a great discount which will take place this January 4th and 5th at their location. Within hours of hearing of the need, five Branford CT businessmen stepped in to pay for the remaining expenses for this service. Police in New Haven and Springfield have been a comfort to the family and many of them plan to attend the funeral for Eric Jr. There is, as you can imagine, much more that needs to be done. This campaign is dedicated to two needs: 1) helping Yokasta recover financially from the incidental costs of the funeral - transportation, lodging, food, clothes, etc. 2) helping Yokasta start a new life in the year to come. She would like to move out of the apartment she shared with her only son and into with one of her sisters. After the funeral the two of them plan to rent a two bedroom apartment outside of New Haven.Yokasta is a valued full-time employee at the 1-95 McDonalds in Madison and plans to return to work there as soon as she is physically and emotionally able. Lets make sure, when that day comes, that she will be living with the surrounding and support she needs and further, that she can start her new life without the added burden of debt. Specifically, around $2,000 from the campaign will go to pay current incidental expenses. The balance raised will be used to secure the new lease and for moving costs. Finally, by way of explanation of how I know the family:  Eric Jr.'s grandmother, Daisy Mangual, has been the lead gardener at The Stand restaurant in Branford, CT (and on that same land before it was The Stand) for over ten years - a place that I helped owners, Eamon Roche and Greg Nobile, dream up a few years back...  and a place where I have spent a ton of wonderful time.     She is an exceptional woman and employee and has shared her family;  her daughters and this incredible little boy with The Stand community over the past two years...   One note that I want to add:  Yokasta did not initiate this campaign.  When approached about it, she waved her hand in complete and utter grief, saying  ""I cannot deal with that right now"".  My hope is that one day - not tomorrow, not next week - but one day, she will be able to open her eyes again and see a life worth living in front of her...and with a few dollars to take that first step.Thank you so much,Maggie____________________________________________________________Service details:Eric Gonzalez Jr. Feb 16, 2012 - December 25, 2016.January 1, 2016Dear Friends and Family,Please join me in commemorating the life of my precious son, Eric Gonzales Jr. who was taken from us this past Christmas Day.The funeral will be held in Springfield, Mass this coming Thursday, January 5th.

Guess the only thing to say is that my Dad is the strongest person I know. Doesn't matter what he's going through he gets up every morning goes to Timmies to get him and Mom and coffee and a timbit for Buddy, who is his best companion, he treats that dog better then us kids I like to joke him, he then walks to work every day. 5 days a week walks down the hill to work, walks up the hill home for lunch and back down the hill for the rest of his shift. If you know my Dad, you've seen him walking up and down that hill at least twice a day every day. Last Thursday at 7pm Mom and Dad recieved a phone call from the Dr saying they had bad news regarding some medical test he had done the previous week. Acute Meyloid Leukimia was the diagnosis. This morning they got a call they had a bed ready for him at the London cancer clinic. As of now he will be there for 3-4 weeks and we're told that he wouldn't be able to return to work again. My Mom, who has been a PSW for many years doing community home care for many people going above and beyond for her paitents has the kindest heart of any woman i know. When we shared paitients i was so proud to hear the wonderful words from them as to how loving and caring my mom is. It has been a loss to her patients as she has had some health issues, not terminal but to a degree that her drs have advised to stop working. She will not be returning to work anytime soon now that my Dad needs her so much more. Mom will be looking for a place to stay in London so she doesn't have to drive back and forth and can be closer to the man she has been married to for 40 years.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/Hope-4-tyler,HOPE 4 Tyler,"Tyler's journey into this world has been a tough one. He was born via emergency c-section at 26 weeks weighing 1 lb 8 oz. While the odds were against him, he has proven to be the strongest boy I know, beating all the odds against him.    The first few weeks were hard but he was slowly making progress in the right direction taking a couple steps backward to only take a few more forward. Until March 2nd everything took a turn for the worse. Tyler suddenly got very ill and had developed Necrotizing Enterocolitis. He was vomiting blood and fading fast, His only hope was to be transfered to the Childrens hospital. The doctors informed us he was so sick there was a good chance he wouldnt even make the trip there. Tyler once again beat the odds and made it safe to childrens hospital but wasnt out of danger yet.    On March 10th Tyler was rushed to surgery where the surgeons found Tylers bowels had perferated. He was too sick and not tolerating the surgery so they had to close without examining this lower bowels which were red, inflammed and matted together. We were told our son was the sickest baby on the unit.   Tylers recovery was hard but he kept pushing on. The doctors again informed us that we are not in the clear yet, They told us he could end up with short bowel syndrome or even worse not be compatable with life if the remainder of his bowels had died.  The future was uncertain but we kept hope.    His next big surgery was June 8th and the plan was to reconnect his bowels and see how much they could salvage. The surgery itself went amazing. He only lost 2 cm of bowel and everything looked great. We thought the worst was over.    Tyler wasnt recovering as expected. His blood pressure plummeted and he went into shock. It took three hours to stabalize him. During that time Tylers kidneys and brain took a huge hit.    On June 22nd we got devistating news that Tylers MRI showed extensive brain damage. Tyler had Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy. We sat with a team of doctors who painted a grim outlook for our son. While the blow was hard, we knew our son has overcome so much that no one thought he would, so we choose to keep hope.    Tyler was finally released from the NICU on June 26th after 161 days in the NICU. We got him started in PT, OT and vision therapy and life was looking up. He was diagnosed with cortical visual imparment in July and we were still managing his high blood pressure, a result from his kidney damage, we were able to have his g-tube removed and things were coming together.     Tyler was developing slowly but on track until in october when he began having seizures. He was diagnosed with Infantile spasms which is a devistating form of epilepsy that causes brain damage.     As you can see Tylers journey has been a hard one. Our lives have been a whirlwind of questions, hospital trips and stays, tears but also HOPE. Tyler amazes us everyday. He is a happy little boy with so much potential.    HOPE has pushed us to look at all the treatments available to Tyler. With all these great treatments comes extensive bills which has brought us here. The long term cost of care and treatments will be immense but we will do whatever is possible to give Tyler the best life possible.    We are taking Tyler to Doctor Roman in PA who is renowed for her work in CVI . She can help assist us with improving Tylers vision and helping him  make sense of what he is seeing. Insurance doesnt cover this trip or the equipment we need to better his sight. We are looking to purchase a light box ($1,312) and light aid ($999) which will help Tyler with visual tracking, visual attention, cause and effect and sequencing. These are tools that will grow with Tyler as he gets older.    We have taken Tyler to private movement lessons (Anat Baniel Method ) and have seen wonderful results. Tyler gains a better sense of himself and how he moves and is more self aware. These lessons are not covered by insurance and are done one week per month with 6-10 lessons that week. Each lesson is $80 so that adds up quickly. We are eager to continue his progress and he gets more benefit from his ABM lessons then his insurance paid physical therapies.    We have also started Tyler on an off label seizure medication that our insurance wont cover. It is working and Tyler has been one month seizure free! We have contacted a group that helps parents in our situation and they have agreed to cover 50% of the cost but that still leaves $300 monthly OOP.    All these therapies, equipment and medication help Tylers brain recover (brain plasticity) and help Tyler become his best. We can't make this happen without the support of the people who love us.    Tyler's first Birthday is January 18th. In lieu of a birthday gift, please consider donating to something he truly needs.    Please consider making a donation or praying for us and our little Prince.    We also have a PayPal account set up for Tyler if you wish to donate that way. If you choose to use paypal, please let us know if it is okay to use your name when we add your ""offline donation"" here.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/Cincinnati-March,Cincinnati Sister WMW March,"Update: I am Billie Mays, one of the organizers of the Cincinnati Sister March in Cincinnati to the Women's March in Washington. I'm from Cincinnati, OH. We started this campaign after overwhelming response to make the march a legally, permitted event in the city of Cincinnati, OH. The majority spoke up to start a gofundme page, and the donations are more than we have ever needed. The money will be used as we have said from the beginning: 1. Permit fee for the march and Washington Park ($350)2. Police fees during march ($836 if nothing changes or we do not run over time)3. Insurance policy required for the march/parade permit ($406). Cheaper than the 500 we planned4. Audio equipment and tech at Wash Park ($325)5. Banner and printing of flyers ($200-300)6. Media and advertising ($200-300)7. Contigency plan as we had no idea what it cost to put this event on $500 8. Excess funds will be used to start planning and securing permits for the Spring/early summer march which will cost the about same depending on the march route. We had a goal of $3,000 and have surpassed that goal. As we discussed on the event page. We would like to have a Spring/early Summer march and we will start planning right away. This was last minute and this event now has over 1,000 people registered. We will start planning the other event in the needed time as we are not rushed and scrambling for plans. To date, I have had to pay all permit fees, service fees, insurance, out of pocket and the money will be withdrawn in my name and deposited into a newly created account to keep the funds from this donation. We will have someone neutral not involved in organizing keep track of receipts and money for this and all events in the future if this kind of amazing generosity keeps up!! Thank you so much for all of your donations and we will have an amazing march on January 21 and a date in the coming months. This is the start of many years of activism to come! United We Stand. Stronger Together. Since the 2016 US election and through the selection of the proposed incoming cabinet, many people in this country are concerned about the future of basic rights for all and especially for those who already must fight against discrimination.    On January 21, 2017, simultaneously with the Women's March on Washington, hundreds of greater Cincinnatians will march downtown to show unity and steadfast commitment to moving ever forward, never backwards on the status of rights in our country.  Please contribute to help cover the necessary expenses for this local March, such as permits, fees, etc...Please Note:-Budget items for this event are not refundable, even in case of inclement weather.-Any amounts in excess of the current goal will be used for future events which are in the planning stages and to help local charities if possible. Follow the event: https://www.facebook.com/events/620743914780648/We will keep everyone posted with budget info as final plans together. Low estimates are around $1900-$2000 for the items we'd need (and like) to cover. We will either start at City Hall or Washington Park (depending on permits, costs, and the amount of donations we receive to cover costs). We will keep you updated and please follow the Facebook Event for all of the latest details and discussion. We will also keep you all informed of all costs as they are aquired and what are final plans are depending on the amount of donations! Let's do this Cincinnati  and all the surrounding areas!! In just 5 days, the passion and energy I feel from you all is amazing. I'm so overwhelmed with the planning (as I had no idea what was involved), but  you inspire me to only want to keep doing more. As this movement progresses, we need help of all kinds. So please contact me on Facebook. Thanks so much in advance for your support! We could not do this financially without you!! We will put our hearts into planning a peaceful, passionate, impactful march! I feel we are about to make history worldwide, and it is our time!!! United we stand.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/search-fund-michael-whitney-john,Search Fund: Michael Whitney & John,"On December 30, 2016 Three of our friends were aboard a plane that went down near Ilio point, Moloka'i. Around 7 pm Friday the Cessna 172 dropped off radar in poor weather conditions and limited visibility.  The U.S. Coast guard has done what they can, but have suspended the search for our loved ones: Michael Childers, Whitney Thomas, and John Mizuno. So far, no trace of them or plane wreckage have been found. Those are the facts; the story of how they disappeared. But the truth is, this is about three people who are so loved, they won't be given up on. These are people who don't just light up a room, they illuminate our lives. We  are surviving on unrelenting hope and faith that there will be some sort of wreckage found, leading us to the next step in our search for these three loved ones. We are asking for support to fund search efforts. Many of our friends have already flown to Molokai to search on foot, while more will be joining over the next few days and weeks to come. The people of Moloka'i have been generously giving support, providing homes, food, direction, knowledge, comfort, and most of all, have given the Thomas', Childer's, and Mizuno's an extended family like no other. The love and affection shown and experienced on Moloka'i is a beacon of hope, faith, and strength to us all.   We are hoping to further expand other search options. Boats with sonar is our next big move being made. Funds will be directly accessable by Whitney's parents, Ben and Christine Thomas, as the beneficiaries. The Thomas' and Childer's are in consistant contact with boats and teams to continue searching the coastline and sea. The families and friends of Michael, Whitney, and John will not stop their efforts in finding anything they can in order to bring these three bright spirits home. If love alone could bring them home, they would have been returned by now. We will not give up you three. We will bring you home.",https://images.gofundme.com/AZcYzBfw9XmiDlspnvTw0vvf-OM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17154128_1483418216.1117.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Carly Thomas is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Christine Thomas.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$40,954 raised of $50,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/marlene-needs-our-loving-support,Marlene needs our loving support,"Marlene Erdman has a huge heart, but it’s about to be shattered. A few months ago she left her job as a recruiter for a small company, where she earned a low salary plus commissions, hoping to get a better position that would enable her to spend more time taking care of our mother, who is at an advanced stage of Parkinson’s and has glaucoma, and to help her 19-year-old son Diego with his education.But things have not worked out as planned, and the business she is trying to start has not yet begun to turn a profit. After sending out over 60 job applications and trying various ways to generate income (even driving her car for UBER and Lift), at 48, Marlene is in a desperate situation, about to have to give up the house she rents in Chula Vista, CA, lose her car and declare bankruptcy, send her ailing mother to a government facility and her son to live with friends.My name is Roxanna and I live in Mexico City; Marlene is my little sister and I am launching this campaign to help her because it is practically impossible to be able to send substantial aid from Mexico since the devaluation of the peso turns any amount we can muster into next to nothing in the U.S.  And we watch with great concern as Marlene, who has been the main breadwinner for her family for many years, not only cannot manage to have a quiet moment but now finds herself in an overwhelming situation.Sixteen years ago, Marlene moved to Tijuana with her son, as a single mother, to help our mother, Alma, a retired nurse, take care of our grandparents, who could no longer live on their own. From then on, Marlene would get up at 4:30 every morning and drive 120 miles a day, taking her son to school, going to work and getting home at 9:00 at night, while her mother took care of the grandparents, who had complicated health problems. In 2011, after both grandparents had passed away, she finally found a modest house in California that would be suitable for our mother (who had begun to have serious trouble walking due to irreparable damage to both knees), and her teenage son. Unfortunately, within a few short months, her mother started having symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, which quickly progressed, causing her overall health to decline.Having to deal with a steady stream of serious health problems (first with the grandparents and now mother) while raising a son (who despite being exceptionally talented at music, has had to leave college for economic reasons) and trying to keep the household financially afloat, has not been easy. And now it has become impossible.Using her extensive experience in personnel recruiting for the manufacturing industry, Marlene drew up a business plan for a private firm, Candidate Pal (visit its internet page, Facebook and other media), which prepares individuals to successfully undergo a personnel selection process. The idea is excellent, but start-up is, of course, slow, and in the meantime Marlene could lose everything, including her family. That is why I am turning to you, to ask you to help come up with the money that Marlene needs so urgently to make it through three or four months until she starts earning enough to get back on her feet.Marlene has a very big heart; for years she has taken care of her loved ones, even at the expense of her own wellbeing. Can we lend her a hand through this tough situation?",https://images.gofundme.com/lHQJKMGb7g2An7nta2BY5QS_GJU=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17154314_1483411787.4222.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Roxanna Erdman is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Marlene Erdman.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$1,646 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mallory-stroub-overcome,Help Mallory Stroub Overcome,"This go fund me page was created to help a dear friend of mine/co-worker, Mallory Stroub. Mallory is a kind-hearted, sweet soul that continuously puts others before herself. She is a single parent of an adorable seven-year-old girl, Kylie. She is a unit clerk/monitor observer/C.N.A. at French Hospital Medical Center. She has an incredibly tough and incomprehensible journey ahead of her, and I’m asking for everyone’s help. Mallory has been an employee of Dignity Health for the past four years and hopes to follow her mother’s footsteps as a registered nurse. In fact, Mallory was accepted into Allan Hancock’s nursing program starting in a couple weeks. Her mother Denise Stroub also worked for Dignity Health for thirty years. Many of you knew Denise from working at Arroyo Grande Community Hospital and Marian Medical Regional Center; she was such a pleasant and thoughtful soul who always had a smile on her face. Her daughters Mallory and Danica, and granddaughter Kylie lived with her in her house in Nipomo. Denise was able to help watch Kylie while Mallory juggled working and being a single parent. Denise was diagnosed with a glioblastoma on December 27th, 2015 and exactly one year later on December 27th, 2016, Denise lost her battle. She is survived by her two sons and two daughters: Kori, Brennan, Mallory, and Danica, and her granddaughters: Kylie and Layla. What’s even more unfathomable for this family is that they lost their father suddenly and unexpectedly in January 2015. This time should be a time that the family can grieve the loss of their mother/grandmother, instead they are faced with stress and financial burdens. Once Denise could no longer work, she had to cancel her life insurance policy because of the outrageous costs. Although they would love to stay in their family home, Mallory and Danica fear losing it. All donations will help with the costs of the mortgage, bills, Kylie’s school and daycare costs, and the costs associated with the nursing program.

We gave ourselves 2 years of wedded bliss until we made the decision in May of 2015 to start trying for a biological child. Unfortunately, after a year with no pregnancy, we decided to get tests done and they showed that we are unable to concieve a child naturally. Basically, that just made it very clear to us that an adoption was going to happen sooner than we planned but we are so excited!Through prayer and discussion, we've decided that a domestic, infant adoption through a private agency is the best route for us to bring our baby home! However, adoption is expensive, so we need your help. In total, the adoption will cost us around $28,000. This money goes toward couseling and support for the birth parents and adoptive parents, legal fees, agency fees and mountains of paperwork. Daniel has been forced out of a job and now we have a much less stable income, so we're extending the campaign in hopes of getting closer to financing the whole adoption debt free!As we could be placed with a child as soon as May, we'd like to have all of the funds lined up as soon as possible so we don't have any obstacles to bringing our sweet baby home!We would love for you to be a part of our story and hope that you prayerfully consider helping us meet our goal!Sincerely, Daniel and Stefanie Mattos",https://images.gofundme.com/obyFPTRN24eAEr_Ad87fwW8rfPs=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17154908_1483413734.455.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Stefanie Mattos is organizing this fundraiser.,"Babies, Kids & Family","$5,150 raised of $7,000 goal"

Furthermore, the structure itself displays a type of beautiful architecture from a bygone era much different than what is seen or constructed today.Though it seems that this fire has scorched a part of our hearts that we hold near and dear, we understand that it is always darkest before dawn.

Most of you that will see this page know how hard it is for me to be able to help my parents, since the military keeps me away. My father became unresponsive on New Years Eve, and was so for 12 minutes. My mom called me while he was still unresponsive. It is excruciatingly painful to hear your mother tell you, while crying, that your father might not last long. Upon ambulance arrival, CPR was conducted. I am happy to say that he is alive. He is healing well from the incident. After receiving multiple tests at the hospital, we were able to find out that he had a heart attack, he was septic, and he had congestive heart failure. What makes this situation even more troubling is my parents insurance was not active until midnight that evening. He received an ambulance ride as well as multiple treatments up until midnight that evening. An ambulance ride can cost anywhere between $300 to $1000 per trip. His treatment for the few hours in the hospital is expected to be in the thousands. On top of that, my parents will be forced to pay the $1800 deductable for the treatment he receives after midnight.

After a short conversation with her doctor, and a quick phone call, a decision was made to transport Amber via ambulance to UAB women and infant center in Birmingham, AL, in hopes to slow down the laboring process and give her baby a little more time to grow. Unfortunately, that means Amber was put on strict bed rest and was in the hospital for the duration of her pregnancy.After a nine day stay in UAB's labor and delivery unit, Amber gave birth to a 23 w and 6d premature preemie weighing in at 1lbs 3oz. The financial burden this has created for Amber is an unmeasurable leave of absence from her current job at Kay Jewelers. With no funds coming in, Amber is struggling to pay bills back home. We are asking for whatever donation you can make, to help make sure all of bills are paid, while she is out of work. Amber's main job right now should be taking care of her newborn preemie, Penelope Rose. Anything will help. If monetary donations are not a possibility for you financially, prayers are greatly appreciated. Amber and her baby have a long road ahead of them. We are hoping Penny will have a healthy start and praying that she keeps improving day by day.",https://images.gofundme.com/bEbElYqUw254G4CIjHXZ8UPb0II=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17155890_1498142462.8473.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Mychelle Proudtobea Dockery is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Amber Abrams.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$3,580 raised of $6,500 goal"

I have decided to continue on this journey raising money for the homeless. Please checkout our updates. Thank you in advance for your heart of Gold, in wanting to give and wanting to help the least of these. The bible says, ""Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for Me.' Matt. 25:40  When I was a child I remember my mother feeding, clothing, and even supplying this homeless man, named Adam, with soap to bathe himself on hot days behind our home. I never understood this. I always asked her why are you doing this? As an adult I clearly understand what she was doing. She was caring and loving towards this man that had no one. His family lived in Poland. She was compassionate to him.   The last three years I've invested my time, money, and have received donations for the homeless. With volunteers, we have made goodie bags of socks, gloves, toothbrushes, toothpaste, wipes, handwarmers, snacks, and feminine items. Some of the goodie bags had lotion, and body wash. For the children we gave puzzles, coloring books, crayons and snacks.   What started off as a family tradition for Christmas has now become something much bigger. 2014 we made 250 bags. 2015 we made over 500 bags. 2016 we made almost 1000 bags. We then take these bags to the homeless shelters and hand them out and ask them if they would like prayer.  I would like to continue doing this monthly. As a believer of Christ I believe its my duty to serve the least of these, and to stand for justice and righteousness.   I will continue to do what I've done. In addition to putting these bags together I have gone out with a few others to the streets of Chicago for the last two years. I have gone to the strip clubs, massage parlors, and dive bars and have spoken and prayed over women that are being trafficked. Do you know that over 85% of women that are trafficked have been sexually abused as children. They have no self worth, or value. I don't question them or judge them. I just love on them.   I will used the money you give me for socks, gloves, snacks, ext. We will hand them out monthly for the homeless and for victims of human trafficking. I'm also putting business cards of church services they can attend and finding programs with more help for them.   Please help me help others. We as a community can make a difference. I will attach pictures of lives that have been touch.   If you have any questions feel free to ask...   Thank you   God bless you!   Lisette   Here are a few shelters.   We go to men shelters, women shelters, and family shelters. We then hand out the goodie bags and ask if they want prayer. Most of the time they want prayer and are hopeful. Lots of hugs are given, we let them know we care. The final picture is of the bags that were made.",https://images.gofundme.com/WoaDe7RHfTWk2pR2Wu7_wzdrhew=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17156068_14838036900_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Lisette Paez is organizing this fundraiser.,"Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$2,695 raised of $5,000 goal"

I met him when I was 15 yrs old.  He has always been a wonderful husband and father to our boys.   He has always been a very hard worker as well.  He became very sick with what we thought was the flu, however he just didn't bounce back after getting over it. He was tired and just didn't have much energy.  Then I found him sitting on the edge of the bed in the middle of the night having trouble breathing. I took him to the ER thinking he probably had bronchitis or pneumonia. They checked him out started running some tests and then came back in looking very concerned and told us he has congestive heart failure and that his heart is only working at a 20% capacity.  They put him on differnt meds and rest. We don't have insurance we have tried to get it but it was so expensive because of a pre existing condition we couldn't afford it.

The biggest single cost incurred in the last few years has been accommodation for visiting artists. How much? $18,000 in 2016, which has, along with some under-attended ticketed shows at last year's festival, put us behind the 8-ball and urgently needing to get back in the black before this year's fundraising can gain traction in February.An individual donation of $95 or more will get you a one-year Friends of the Festival membership - follow this link for full details: http://www.bendigobluesandroots.com.au/get-involved/friends-of-the-festival/According to an Economic Impact Report produced by City of Greater Bendigo, BB&RMF generated more than $3.4million for Bendigo's economy in 2016 and created up to 17 jobs. But that money doesn't translate to income for the Festival's bank account, nor does it mean paid jobs for our director or volunteer staff.Regardless of the amount, your contribution this month will help us keep the festival going and your reward will be the continuation of Australia's biggest and best community-run music festival and the continued invigoration of the Central Victorian music scene on a grass-roots level.We need to raise $18k by Feb 3rd.  Your donation will be appreciated by our volunteer team, by the artists who have the pleasure of playing our festival and by the many punters who get to enjoy the festival and it's many spin-off events through the year.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-boggs-hospital-bills,The Boggs' Hospital Bills,"Those of you who know Nathaniel and Jenny Boggs, know that Jenny was admitted to the ICU due to Diabetic Ketoacidosis at the beginning of November, after her 25th birthday. The DKA resulted in her being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, and a few days stay in the ICU and then on to the Telemetry wing. She was kept in the hospital to make sure her BG levels were brought down, other markers found in her blood were brought back to normal, and to be quickly educated on the big life change she had ahead of her.  Upon release she was immediately in charge of going out and paying for all of the things that a Type 1 Diabetic needs to survive: a BG meter, lancets, test strips, two types of insulin, and the pen needles needed for the insulin pens. Being a Type 1 Diabetic is extremely expensive, even after insurance pays for it's part, and unfortunately the Boggs' had to dip into the Grad School/Moving fund they had set up.Thankfully, after 2 months of this new life, Jenny is doing really great and is staying on top of her Type 1 through her Insulin and eating balanced meals.Unfortunately, through a stroke of unluckiness, Nathaniel found himself spending almost a week in the hospital at the beginning of December, due to a softball size abscess found in his liver. After running a fever Halloween weekend, Nathaniel went to Same Day Care and was sent home being told it was just a virus. He began getting additional symptoms every few days. He started a journey of continually going to see doctors to find an answer and a solution to the miserable way he was feeling.  He visited Same Day Care again (being told it could be Whooping Cough), the ER a week later (being told it was an upper respiratory infection) , and a primary care physician the next week (some type of inflamation). Thankfully, later that same week due to connections at the school he teaches at, he had an appointment with a Doctor of Internal Medicine, which is when he was admitted to the hospital to actually figure out what was wrong, instead of guess work.Thanks to a CT scan, the abscess was finally found, biopsied, and drained. However, since the abscess wasn't drained until a few days into his hospital stay, after he had been on antibiotics the whole time, they were not able to culture anything taken from the abscess to figure out what type of infection had caused the abscess to grow. Nathaniel has been out of the hospital since December 8th, and has been doing an at home antibiotic IV through a PICC line since then. He recently had another CT Scan done and we are waiting to hear back about it. Hopefully the abscess has completely dissapeared by now.We have received such an amazing outpouring of love, support, prayers, gifts, and well wishes over the past 2 months, and it has left us absolutely speechless and overwhelmed with thankfullness. We both are still on our parents health insurance, and those policies have paid a large chunk of our medical expenses. However, the amount leftover is still way too much for us to pay on our own, and our finances would be stretched too thin when it comes to the 12 month payment plan the hospital has to offer us. Any money that we receive will be going towards the payment of our hospital stays, and other health bills we have received from various medical departments.

Tammy Cortes passed away suddenly while on a family vacation in Nashville with her husband Kevin and their two daughters. At just 43 years old, this was a sudden and heartbreaking loss for her family and friends. The news of her passing has shocked and devastated us all. Tammy lived her life to make others happy. She was the warmest, kindest person you could ever have the joy of knowing. She has helped raise and care for many of our children through her in-home daycare. All of her 'daycare family' knew our children were not just kids that attended there, they were all extensions of her family. She was adored by all of the kids she cared for and had such a special bonds with them all. Family meant everything to Tammy  and the bond within her family illistrates this. She had a zest for life and an eagerness to make a difference in other people's lives. Between Tammy's daycare, school fundraisers, town events and Kevin's recent position as a RCMP Auxiliary Constable with the local RCMP, this family has contributed to and supported so many of us throughout the community. Kevin, and his girls, will most definitely need to take some time to deal with thier loss. Being in another country  has understandably made all of this much harder, and complicated things as well.

Studies have shown that most people think that boys are better suited for Computer Science, but Moxie Girls are driven to prove those people wrong. This is the club’s first year and we are anxious to show these girls how amazing and powerful their roles in Computer Science can be. Since our debut in August of 2016, we have had a lot of recognition throughout our local school district, and have been asked to speak at several panels within the state of Arizona.  Through our social media outlets, we have also influenced other like-minded young women throughout the world, inspiring more and more girls to think outside the box and strive to make impactful change in their lives and in the world around them.One of our main focuses for the club is to try to maintain it as a free club, available for any girl interested in joining. By eliminating the financial burden, we hope to draw in as many different types of girls that can explore their own interest and abilities within Computer Science, thus further closing the gender gap within this field (both in the higher education settings as well as within the professional settings). To continue to offer this club free of cost to students, we need outside funding to help cover material costs for different events, as well as hands-on experiences. During the year-long program, the girls explore the world of coding and robotics, working with Makey Makeys, Raspberry Pi, Spheros, Little Bits, and much, much more. Some of the upcoming activities that we are specifically fundraising for include, the design, education and programing of drones; materials to give the girls hands-on access to real-world applications to circuitry; equiptment for the creation of Moxie Girls podcast, so the girls can further share their voice and story to inspire their peers. Our goal is to acquire the necessary funding by March 2017 so we can acquire the tools needed to execute the activities mentioned above before the school year is out. This money is so important to our club to continue to offer this wonderful club to the young girls in our community. The disproportionate ratio to male to female within this field is alarming imbalanced and it is critical that we expose the young female population and show them all of the many applications in the real world settinds, and more importantly, what they are capable of achieving in Computer Science. We would be so very grateful to anyone able to support our cause. Our goal is to continue to inspire future generations of young girls with each coming year and we ask you not only to think of just the girls in our community, but to think of what this movement can mean for every young girl you know in your life that you can imagine this club having a life-changing impact on.  https://moxiegirls.org",https://images.gofundme.com/9F9k2C9eFO7PUydQ41GR5YVq1_k=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17156526_1483418981.2191.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Got Moxie is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$1,721 raised of $2,000 goal"

The skills gained will benefit his future playing. He will also get much more exposure participating at these tournaments, which he will not get from playing on the local league.

If all goes well, he can try-out for yearly. When all costs are added together, it will run between $1,950 & $2,300, depending on how many of the winter sessions we are able to sign up for. The training/conditioning sessions start at $110 per month for 8 sessions.  Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.

As the prognosis with “standard of care” chemo therapy is 2 years at best, I have found alternative treatment out of the States in a renowned world-class alternative cancer center – part of a major hospital employing cutting-edge proven treatments, with excellent survival rates for my situation. So I’m writing to you because Cynthia and I are in an emergency mode with this latest development.

No matter what life has placed in their path, their commitment has remained steadfast throughout their marriage of 35 years.  As we know, life isn’t always kind, nor fair, but we grow with each experience and hold close each joy for the blessing it is. Over the past sixteen years, Steve was met with some challenging occurrences, starting with triple bypass heart surgery in 2000. Then, in May 2014, a very risky but successful abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, a surgery with a 50/50 chance of survival.  However, his kidneys began to show signs of deterioration due to his coronary heart disease. Still, their faith never wavered. In January 2015, Gayle donated a healthy kidney to her husband at the University of Wisconsin. Steve now takes approximately (29) pills per day to maintain his health but you won’t hear them complain. Steve is now a disabled veteran. In July 2016, Gayle’s employer sold their company and she lost her accounting position. Her unemployment is depleted. She has applied for new positions with several employment agencies but we all know that it doesn’t take but one month to fall behind. Their fifteen year old automobile is becoming less dependable and Gayle needs safe transportation when she finds her new position. Medical insurance is essential for Gayle to provide Steve with any necessary life saving medications or hospital stays. Sometimes there are good people who just fall on hard times and need a helping hand. A chance to get back on their feet.

My life waschanged forever in an instant.  Like every teenager I was so excited aboutgetting my license but as you can imagine that didn’t happen. But with theextensive rehab I have been able to do, I now know I can drive if I can geta vehicle set up (really built) just for my needs. My Mom has been fantastic she has been taking me everywhere I need to goand that has been great, but it limits her to not being able to have a job,so my dad is the only working member of the family currently. I was blessed with the opportunity to go Atlanta during rehab and drive avehicle while at the Shepherds center so now I know now that I can drive ifI could get the funds needed to have a vehicle custom built for me. I have been able to finish my high school and have just completed my firstyear at Volunteer state community college, I am studying environmentalScience which has been great for me but again my Mom must take me every dayand come and pick me up, on my short days she just sits in the car andwaits for me. It would be great to have my own vehicle and the feeling of being able todrive myself and not having to depend on someone else all of the time. Wehave been able to get the cost for such a vehicle and it is extremelyexpensive the cost of independence is really going to be a lot of money.You can you-tube the vehicles and see how they operate the entire sideopens and a lift lowers down so I can get my wheel chair on to the liftthen it raises up and the side closes, it is pretty awesome but theopportunity for me to be independent would be great.The cost for the modifications needed on a truck are $59,761 plus the costof a truck which would be $27000 to $32,000 depending on options. I knowthis seems like a lot of money and it is, but I have full plans to completemy college and get a job and become a productive member of society. Irealize these dollar amounts are higher than my previous figures but theywere estimates and after having the opportunity to drive in Atlanta theynow know almost exactly what I will need to completely be able to safelydrive.  This is more than a dream it is my goal I must make this happen andI cannot do it without your help.

At 3 in the morning he asked us to take him to an Urgent Care near Caryn's home. Several CT's later they determined he was bleeding into his abdomen-possibly from his spleen. One ambulance ride later he was admitted to St Davids Round Rock Medical Center. After 4 days he was released. Diagnosis: splenic laceration or a tear in his spleen. The surgeon did not want remove the spleen of an otherwise healthy 32 year old so they kept him under observation hoping the tear would heal on its own. More CT's, labs, medications and lots of surgical consults all result in a very large bill! Chris' job doesn't provide insurance so this is going to be a huge hit to his finances.

It's not a huge accomplishment but it's the commitment that counts. After watching Ian's battles over the past months, my battle will be nothing in comparison.  I'll give this my best shot and I may fall short but it's my vehicle to getting some momentum behind this so we can all help a mate out.Ian's been my mate for more than 10 years now, he's a fantastic guy and I know I'm not the only one that wants to do something to help.  Please join me in helping Ian, Liz & their beautiful boys while also looking after your own health and wellbeing - I think that's something Ian would like us all to appreciate more and strive for!

These medications called pressers draw blood from the extremities and send it to the more important organs like the brain, heart etc., and because my Mom was on these medications so long it caused irreversible side effects to her legs and arms.  (After making every attempt to get better before her amputaintion surgeries my Mom caught another infection and became septic again!! )The side effects caused my Mother to have both legs partially removed below the knee and both arms partially removed below the elbow.  the Money that will be raised will be for Prosthetics, anyone who knows my Mom is aware of how out going, faithful, hos independent she is, and also how much she loves her children and Grand Baby Leah.  It hurts me everyday to have to see her and remember every struggle from November 1, 2016, however with the prayers of so many people she is still here with us and continues to fight, she is the strongest women I know with such a testimony to tell.  And in her own words "" I can't wait to get back to church so I can dance and praise the Lord"".My Family and I thank all of you for your Prayers, words of encouragement and any donations made towards my Moms prosthetics, medical bills and home care.  She is a living Miracle twice over and deserves every opprotunity that I can make possible, I dont want my Mom to miss her hands for her feet.",https://images.gofundme.com/jDn9KXzc_JizrnT8zLPhRGPPT4w=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17157438_15128285500_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Lakisha St.Hill is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$12,815 raised of $150,000 goal"

After 26 years here on earth, our dearest Lydia went to be with the Lord on January 2nd, 2017.  Lydia was a loving daughter, cousin, niece, and selfless, caring older sister.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/operation-get-arlo-walking-awlq,AWLQ Operation Get Arlo Walking,"This is Arlo and she needs your help.Three weeks ago this super cute blue female English staffy pup was brought to us at Animal Welfare League Queensland in a laundry basket. Her back legs weren’t working.Our AWLQ Community Vet Clinic and Shelter Vet Clinic teams examined the nine week old pup to see if her legs were broken, if there were any issues with her spine and whether she had feeling in her feet.While the test results pointed to possible Neosporosis they were inconclusive. An external Specialist has also examined her and blood work also failed to determine what causes her leg failure.What we do know is that Arlo has a love of life and a desire to live life to the absolute fullest. When Arlo first came into AWLQ’s care her ‘walking’ involved dragging her back legs behind her. In just three short weeks Arlo now is now standing, walking and running on wobbly legs for short periods of time.Her ambition is to be like the big dogs she is fostered with. This combined with hydrotherapy, massage, manipulation, a daily exercise regime and a potentially lifesaving course of antibiotics, have all made an incredible difference.We’ve now taken the next step to ensure we know exactly what is going on and the only way was to undertake an expensive, but necessary, spinal tap. Armed with these results the Doctors can prescribe the best course of treatment. Arlo never ceases to amaze us and with each day her hind legs are getting stronger and her balance and coordination is improving too. Arlo’s personality is just bursting out of her little puppy body and her positivity is contagious. Arlo isn’t that pup that you look at and feel sorry for because her hind legs don’t work properly. Instead she inspires everyone who meets her. As much as her progress fills us with hope, we do know that Arlo still has a long road ahead of her filled with rehabilitation, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and massage.With your help we can repay the cost of the spinal tap ($1,200), fund her rehab, physio, hydrotherapy, a life vest for Arlo to feel confident in the water and cost of medication. We are setting a goal of $3,000 and if, through the incredible generosity of the community we surpass that goal, these donations would go towards other animals in our care at AWLQ who also need intensive treatment or diagnostics.  AWLQ would like to say a big Thank You to everyone who takes the time to read Arlo’s story, watches her amazing progress and love of life on the video, shares it and donates to help Arlo on her journey. Our ambition is that Arlo will get to play with the big dogs forever.",https://images.gofundme.com/VaMFcm3pfzgIKObJA5o16vEw7Og=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Up-Uakbctd0/0.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Awl Qld is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$5,225 raised of $3,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36mzsog,Help Send Benji to a Sanctuary,"￼Hi my name is Benji. I am a ten-year-old Australian Shepherd with a ton of life, energy and love to give. I was rescued nine years ago. When my family brought me home they began to see I had issues socializing and had clearly been through something that they were not aware of. They hired trainers and even a dog psychologist for me and all of them told my parents that I was a lost cause. Then came my favorite person, Michelle from Trail Dogs. She saw the real me and knew that with the right encouragement, I would blossom to be the beautiful dog that I am today. It wasn't the easiest road but now, 3 years later, I have worked my butt off to become the best dog I can be. I went from not being able to walk by a fence with dogs behind it, to being able to enjoy hikes with a pack of dogs! I have so much potential and I am SO smart; you can teach me anything!! The catch is, I’ve only been able to do this with Michelle. Nobody else has put the time, work or effort in needed for me to succeed. Unfortunately my family didn't put the work or any effort in so while I did GREAT with Michelle, I defaulted to my old behaviors at home. They decided they didn’t want me anymore and they gave Michelle only 3 days to find me a place to go or they were going to euthanize me. Luckily she didn’t let that happen, & found me a temporary foster family. She then found me a forever home....but unfortunately they weren’t up to the task of working through my issues and giving me a chance (even though through extensive conversation, vetting & transparency they claimed they were), so they returned me after only 7 days. All of these changes and moves have been really hard on me and I really just need a place that will accept me for who I am and let me live out my days comfortably. Now I am on borrowed time. I HAVE TO BE OUT OF WHERE I AM STAYING BY THIS THURSDAY - 2/22. Michelle found me a sanctuary for aggressive/difficult dogs that cannot be placed!! They even have a few Aussies just like me!! I can stay here for the rest of my life and get everything I’ve ever needed and hoped for. The cost is $5000. Please help save me. I am a really great guy with a ton of potential. I need to be with someone that understands my needs and can provide me with structure and boundaries. Brandon Fouche’s dog sanctuary is without a doubt my best bet and they are willing to give me a forever home. PLEASE HELP - DONATE, SHARE.

They took him in right away and told us immediately that the outlook was not in our favor. It was a long journey for our grandpa having to spend Christmas and New Years away from home and away from his little doggie companion, Holly. The doctor initially told us that he would be a candidate for palliative care but as the days went on in the hospital that was no longer an option. He was extremely dependent on his ventilator which made it impossible for him to come home. On December 31, 2016 our abuelito passed away at 6:50 p.m.This is a very difficult time for all of us. Our father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and all of our funds have needed to go to his cancer treatments.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/dcern,CERN Internship funds,"Follow me on Instagram: duncan.cern (https://www.instagram.com/duncan.cern/) My name is Duncan Shaw. I am currently a senior at HSU studying physics. I intend to go to college for one more year before getting a B.S. in Physics. Afterwards I want to go to a top graduate school and pursue a PhD in Particle physics.     This summer I've been given the amazing opportunity to work at the LHC at CERN doing ATLAS research in an 8 week internship. For those who don't know, the LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider. It is a 17 mile long ring in Geneva, Switzerland that sends particles smashing into each other at near the speed of light. Working at this facility is considered by many to be the pinnacle of particle physics, even physics in general. Going here this summer would prepare me for future research projects and introduce me to a career in particle physics, establishing connections to top physicists. This will also add an important experience for my resume when I apply to graduate school and may be the judge I need to get accepted into a to institution such as Stanford.     In order to be able to work at CERN this summer however, I will need to provide travel and lodging for myself. CERN is located in Geneva Switzerland. The Professor in charge of the internship estimates that all expenses considered, this trip will cost around 6,000 USD.  I will be able to get some funding through the college and scholarship programs, as well as save money myself but it will be a far cry from the $6,000 needed for the trip. The money will be spent on a bus to and from San Francisco, a round trip plane ride from San Fransicso to Geneva, hotel cost for a shared room near the research facility, food, and personal expenses. Any money raised in excess of the $6,000 goal will be used to cover an unforseen costs and purchase books at the start of the next semester.      I succesfully raised about half of the money by the end of January, meeting a deadline for airline tickets and my hotel, but I still have a bit to go by the end of May, when I begin my internship.     Any amount you can contribute will be a tremendous help to me. Even a few dollars will pay for a days worth of meals. This is the opportunity of a lifetime in the most literally sense, and I can't express how grateful I am to be able to participate.

To add to injury, on the day of the break in my car broke down which has left us in a financial set back. We are only asking for the amount which would account for those losses so that we are back on track. Anything would mean the world. If anybody could be kind enough to donate ANY amount of money to put towards this visa we would really really apreciate it. We understand it's a tought period of time; post-Christmas, New Years, Woodford etc. so if you can't muster any spare change that's understandable. This Visa would mean the world to us, as it means we can have some sort of stability going into the future. Thank you so much With LOVE, Brodie & Mel",https://images.gofundme.com/F2MXEc3HrMoa_eIoUK1KEHePhfg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158572_1483425328.4829.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Brodie Graham is organizing this fundraiser.,"Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$2,950 raised of $2,500 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/kyrgyzstanmission,Kyrgyzstan Mission Trip Fund,"Hello (привет) everyone! :) My name is Nadia Ajdari. I'm 21 years old and have grown up in Calgary, Canada. I love to learn, to work with people, and it has been a long-time dream of mine to work abroad as a missionary and as a teacher. I'm very excited to share with you an opportunity that I have received to work as a missionary English teacher in Kyrgyzstan, beginning in September of 2017.Kyrgyzstan is a beautiful, mountainous country located in Central Asia. This impoverished country was part of the former Soviet Union and culturally has Russian and Turkish roots. The country's official languages are Russian and Kyrgyz, and the majority of the population is Muslim while a minority is Russian Orthodox. The education of alternate languages is not an integral part of the school system in Kyrgyzstan. Learning new languages such as English and Spanish provides students with opportunities to pursue education and careers internationally. Learning languages particularly provides female students with careers in translation, which are otherwise uncommon for women in Kyrgyzstan. Students' families and communities also benefit from the opportunities students receive from learning international languages and qualifying for post-secondary education. Due to the importance of the education of languages, parents make sacrifices to send students to schools that offer English education. One school that offers both English and Spanish education is Nasledie Seventh-Day Adventist School. Nasledie School educates students from kindergarten to grade 12 and is the only SDA School in the Euro-Asia division. The school is located in Tokmok, a city of approximately 50 000 people found in the north of the country. Nasledie School is focused on providing students an education that will equip them for international post-secondary education through an appropriate formation in English/Spanish basics and international communication. The learning objectives of the language classes at Nasledie School include the following:1. The development of grammatical and speaking skills through social interaction.2. The development of good values through the interaction of peers, teachers and foreigners.3. The creation of an environment of trust and respect between students.4. The creation of an inclusive community between the students in the school and those in the local community.Languages have the potential to unite people of different backgrounds. An education in languages hopes to increase the appreciation, concern and care that students have towards the community at both a local and international scale. Nasledie School's mission statement is the ""holistic personal development for a meaningful life in the present and the future.""The education of languages at Nasledie School began one year ago. To date, Nasledie School has demonstrated success in sending its students to universities in Mexico and Argentina. Due to its long waiting list of students, Nasledie School is currently undergoing an expansion and is in need of teachers. I hope to work at the school as an English teacher for students in all grades.The languages project at Nasledie School has grown very dear to me. The potential behind this project is enormous for numerous communities in a country in which opportunities for academic growth and international exposure are limited. I hope to be living in the school and working for the nine-month duration of the 2017-18 school year. In order to live and work in this country, Nasledie School has calculated the total financial cost for my position to be $6,720, needed before the summer of 2017. The cost will cover travel, insurance and documentation, living expenses, as well as a stipend. I am very thankful that you have taken the time to read about this life-changing opportunity. Your support is deeply encouraging to myself and the entire missionary team at Nasledie School. Any contribution you can provide via finance or prayer is invaluable to the lives of entire communities in Kyrgyzstan. For more information regarding the school and mission, please visit the Nasledie School Facebook page. God bless you.Nadia",https://images.gofundme.com/MAxp9Rw7cobSFd4Iq2md5Hm_XEM=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483511360.9866.png,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483561645.3202_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483562517.2859_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1486862793.7545_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1484502538.2683_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1486862832.9142_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483562557.3883_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483562595.2924_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483562667.1761_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17158644_1483562704.8318_funddescription.png']",9,"Created January 4, 2017",Nadia Ajdari is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$6,769 raised of $6,720 goal"

This is a once in a life time opportunity for me to showcase my talents at one of the world's biggest film festivals and make connections with prominent filmmakers and industry professionals. Which brings me to my next point. Realizing my love and passion for theatrics and the fine arts, I have decided to pursue a career in the movie industry, Hollywood more or less. With that being said, I have also decided to change majors from Civil Engineering to Film. I believe that the Cannes International Film Festival will provide me with more knowledge about the industry and its inner workings and give me valuable experience and skills through the festival's workshop programs - skills and experience I wish to put on a resume.I know money is tight and the holidays hit all our wallets pretty hard, but if 200 of my friends on Facebook donate at least $10, we can easily reach the target amount.Thank you everyone for your continuous support and God bless!",https://images.gofundme.com/3ShMrsCcnyX_nASKKu3ABXwqhT0=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvT8H-MA4sA/0.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Adrian Manila is organizing this fundraiser.,"Creative Arts, Music & Film","$2,411 raised of $2,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/isupporthoney,Honey's Family House Fire,"On Saturday December 17th, just one week before Xmas, Honey Squeeze and her mother lost their family home and everything in it to a devastating house fire. Thankfully this happened while no one was home and their treasured Moodles Lucy and Toby, and their tiny kitten Reggie are all ok, but the family has lost pretty much everything.  Honey's mother suffers terribly with disability issues, and will be finding it even harder now that her CPAP machine has been destroyed.  To make matters even worse, Honey is recovering from major surgery and is unable to work.   While insurance will help, it will by no means cover everything they’ve lost, and will likely take a while to come together.  Right now though they need to replace their personal affects.  Most needed are quilts, pillows, linen, clothes, shoes, underthings, toiletries, pet food, everyday use appliances, etc to get their lives on track a little while they try to cope with this and plan their next steps. If you know Honey and would like to help in a more personal way, gift cards are great.  Bunnings, Petbarn, Woolworths, Coles Myer vouchers are some of best options at this stage.  Any donation, big or small, will be incredibly appreciated will mean the absolute world to them both.  Honey's mother never buys anything for herself, or asks for anything.  And, Honey, who is also her mother's carer, is truly one of the most incredible people I've ever known. So, let's please help them with this first step towards rebuilding their lives.

Not a lot is known about the accident itself as it is still under investigation, but I do know that Greg is still in ICU fighting for his life. Greg is in a induced coma with multiple broken ribs, a broken pelvis, and a broken leg. He's in critical condition with multiple tubes coming out of his head. Greg will have a tremendous amount of medical payments, and a ongoing mortgage payment considering he just bought his first condo a few months ago. The money raised in this campaign will go directly towards Greg in hopes that it will relieve some of the financial burden this accident has placed on his family. Greg is my best friend, my soulmate. I would do the world for him, and I know he would do the same for me. I was with him the night of the accident, and it just breaks my heart that I couldn't do anything for him to relieve the pain. Greg is the most caring and loving person I ever met. He has the biggest heart, and always put everyone else before himself.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-hands-school-cambodia,"Helping Hands School, Cambodia","Many of my Facebook friends followed by adventures volunteering in an impoverished rural school 25 kms from Siem Reap, Cambodia in November 2014 and know what an amazing experience it was for me. It's time for me to return. You can’t help but be affected by the Cambodian people. They have so little but give so much. Their smiles and warmth, acceptance of their life and appreciation of even the smallest things are very humbling but it was the children at the project that truly won my heart. My role in the school was to assist the teachers by working with the children on pronunciation and to allow them to hear English from a native speaker. I was also lucky enough to be able to prepare and deliver some very easy lessons – something I never expected to do but which I thoroughly enjoyed.During my 2 weeks I also visited the village homes of some of the children. It is obvious that the parents of these children, some of whom have no literacy or numeracy and suffer debilitating illness, are desperate for their children to have the opportunity of education that they didn’t have. Helping Hands, the Globalteer school project, plays a big part in this.Not only is English and Khmer taught at Helping Hands but they also provide a healthy, nourishing breakfast to 150 students every day. Sometimes it is the only meal the children will have for the day. While I was there in 2014 a vegetable garden was established and these vegetables, along with rice and fish, is served to the children free of charge.The current school is made of bamboo and palm fronds with half walls and no protection from the weather. When it rains, as it does for many months of the year during Monsoon season, the children, books and desks get wet. The village chief has donated a piece of land to allow Globalteer/Helping Hands to building a new set of classrooms that will be weatherproof. They finally have planning approval and now comes the process of raising the money to pay for it. I would love to arrive in Cambodia with a contribution towards this wonderful endeavour and so am asking for your help. I know we are all constantly being bombarded to raise money for good causes. I apologise for adding to this and have no expectations but, if you do feel you can spare just a few dollars for this wonderful project, I know the children  will benefit 10 fold.The teachers and children at the project are exceptional. They are the future of Cambodia. Although they come from a very poor village that is barely accessible by road during certain times of the year, with no electricity, plumbing or clean water these children aspire to be doctors, teachers, accountants and movie stars! I have no doubt that these dreams, for at least for some of the children, will be realised.I would be eternally grateful for any contribution you feel you can afford.",https://images.gofundme.com/Xd4LgTwJTVDoMdUnXmoOUgAT6cA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17159774_1483433671.3051.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Sally Bateman is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$2,000 raised of $1,000 goal"

This is now in remission, but having undergone both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she still experiences recurrent bouts of cellulitis. The cancer diagnosis also led to her being removed from the lung transplant list, so any hope of improvement to her quality of life was eliminated. Zena is on permanent oxygen therapy and to exist on a daily basis endures more than we can ever imagine. Despite this she is a strong and resolute woman who is determined to make the best possible life for herself and her family. Her positivity and resolve shine through in her day to day life. She is artistic and creative and puts her talents to good use, e.g. designing and making costumes for a local drama group. She has a wicked sense of humour which she maintains in the face of adversity.Just over a year ago, Zena lost her beloved father, Derek. Despite the pain of this loss, this gave her the opportunity to buy her own home. She acquired a property in Harold Hill in need of substantial renovation and appointed a builder to undertake the work. The builder was someone she had known closely for many years and trusted implicitly. The work commenced last September and some progress was made. However the week before Christmas, the builder disappeared, taking Zena’s inheritance with him.This has been devastating and massively hurtful. Zena has no means of recouping this loss. She has been left with an uninhabitable house and lacks the funds to progress with the unfinished work. Even pursuing the builder through the police and courts will not get the money back. We know friends and relatives have been shocked by this terrible event and many have offered assistance; some financial.

On  December 6, 2016  my children and I had just reached hilo walmart to buy a couple of things when all of a sudden my youngest  child named Constance  Ponce whom is 9 years old grabbed her chest and yelled out ""MOMMY MY HEART!!!!!!!!!!"" At this moment I turned to looked at my precious  baby whom was pale like a ghost, screaming and crying  at the top of her lungs in pain collapsed to the floor. Upon collapsing to the floor she was breathing and had a pulse. Without any hesitation my son Gauge whom is 11 years of age picked her up off of the floor i told my eldest daughter Cerciyana lets go were taking her to the hospital!!!. As were running to the car I began to call 911 , at this point we are driving out of walmart stuck in traffic. Constance regains contiousness. And is still screaming  and crying due to the pain in her heart, she is still pale ,sweating,  has shortness of breath when I asked her what does her pain in her heart feel like she said it felt like someone was punching  her on her heart very hard. As a mother you try to stay calm, but all I can think about was Ohh my god my daughter  is having a heart attack.  I'm still on the phone with the dispatcher whom was extremely  nice told me not to worry EMS is on the way if I could pullover so they could intercept her from me. I pulled into Bank of Hawaii parking lot where I kept my phone on Bluetooth as I put my vehicle  in park, I ran around  to calm her and to Check her pulse, her heart rate was 169 - 182 bpm varying. All her symptoms  still persist I told her to just lay back take deep breaths help is on its way.  Even though my heart sunk to my stomach  I could  not let her see me fall apart. And that's when she told me ""MOMMY I DON'T WANT TO DIE, AM I GOING TO DIE?????"" I told her no baby your not going to die the ambulance  is almost her ok baby just relax.  Meanwhile the dispatcher is still on the phone with me asking how she is doing so I tell him her symptoms are still present.  A moment  later HFD and EMS came. They started to ask her some questions and asked me some questions  then they put her on the Machine  to check her stats, with one EMT shaking his head to the other one saying get her on the EKG machine.  After they did there reading they told me ""mom somethings wrong with her heart, somethings not right, as I over here the other 2 talking to each other saying we need to get her to the hospital  now.  I asked if my eldest daughter could ride with her and they said no for safety  reasons.  I said ok. I got in my car and begin to follow them to Hilo Medical  Center.I began to call my family, her grandparents and my Boyfriend whom is not her Biological father but whom has raised her from when she was a little girl.  As we reach Hilo Medical Center we weren't allowed to go into her room for they were working on her. As I patiently waiting  they finally let me and my children  in .  As we got into her room she looked droopy and tired and still was having shortness of breath, still pale as a ghost and her eyelids and around  her eyes were Pink. The doctor  came in said they need to do another EKG on her because  no one knows where the EKG from The EMS went.  Her symptoms were present for about 15 to 20 min. After running  tests on her and all the family  members  trickling in the doctor came into the room and asked to speak to the adults only. My Heart Sunk even deeper. He stated he was worried and that she needs to get to Kapiolani Children's  Hospital  to see the pedestrian Cardiologist. Her test shows that she has an Electrical  Shortage in her heart, what he believes  she has is BRUGADAS Syndrome which is a fatal Heart Arythmia and she can die from it.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36nnva8,A New Guitar For Chris!,"Hello, my name is Alex Estrella, and my husband's name is Chris Estrella. He is a talented liturgical, praise & worship, and professional Roman Catholic-Christian musician, who works for the Diocese of San Bernardino, where we live. We were just married this past June (see him playing guitar at our reception in the picture!).  Chris has been a professional Catholic musician for over 8 years, since before I met him, and he has always brought smiles (and occasionally tears) to the faces of those he ministers to.  This past Thanksgiving, I asked him what he wanted for Christmas, and he said ""Nothing, really. But if we were rich, I'd probably get a new guitar."" You see, he had been playing this guitar, a Martin model, for over 4 years, and it had significant wear on it (it is literally ""falling apart"", but he has always appreciated his instruments, to the end of their lives). So, in an act of support, I told him that, the next day, Black Friday, he should purchase a new one. He paid for much of our wedding with money earned from his music & speaking ministry, and I thought he had earned a new one for himself. He bought a $900 Taylor (still a humble guitar compared to others, but he's never been extravagant about his instruments). He had never owned or played a Taylor before, and wanted to give the brand a shot, since he'd played a Martin for 4 years prior.  Fast-forward only a few weeks, to Wednesday, December 21st, and we went with family to watch Star Wars (Chris is a movie super-freak, and often organizes HUGE groups of friends & family to local movie premiers) in San Bernardino, when, on that rainy night, and just minutes before we left the theater, our car, a Mitsubishi SUV, was broken into, and robbed.  The thieves caused $370 of damage to the car (we DO have insurance, but this was not covered), and stole 7 items: A microphone safe case, containing 4 Audix microphones, and...his brand new Taylor guitar, in its brand new travel case. He was devastated, as you can imagine. Total cost of repair and loss: around $1700.  All this right in the midst of the Advent & Christmas season was not a very nice surprise for us.  The windows were tinted, and the equipment was pretty well-concealed in the trunk in the dark, in the rain, in a well-populated parking lot with security. But these things happen in life, often without explanation. All in all, we have accepted that those items are now gone, and will not be returned. Chris has remained relatively positive about it, only hoping that some good comes out of the situation (""Perhaps the culprits will use the items for good"").  Chris is still continuing his ministry (he has a lesser-quality guitar that he is using in the meantime, and he plays other instruments as well), but has a big year of speaking & music ahead (he has an album in the works, which has been put on hold in the meantime), and is in need of a new quality instrument, but we are now without the funds to do that (he is still paying off the credit funds used to purchase the Taylor in the first place).  Your contribution, if you find yourself able to give, will go towards:  1) Replacing the stolen Guitar with a new one of comparable quality. 2) Purchase of a quality travel case to protect a new guitar. 3) Paying off the debt incurred by the previous guitar purchase, and the vehicle repair.  If you find yourself able to give, it is appreciated. If you find yourself unable to contribute, your PRAYERS are very very appreciated. Chris has brought much joy and healing to thousands of people in his ministry work over the years. We appreciate all support (Great or Small) and all contributors will be commemorated in thankfulness.  Thanks and Blessings, -Alex [and Chris] Estrella",https://images.gofundme.com/IA318jZRqpMYfWux71AUX8DBmvc=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17160616_14835169680_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Chris Estrella is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"$1,570 raised of $1,200 goal"

I have been going on about it quite a lot, I know... :-) Training is now officially underway!Who am I running for?I'm not just running for 'fun' - although marathons can actually be fun in many ways, honest! I'm also running for an extremely good cause. I've chosen to run for Helping Refugees in Jordan  (HRJ) - a group that I helped out volunteering with while I lived in Jordan for a few months in 2014-2015.What does HRJ do?Helping Refugees in Jordan (HRJ) - an affiliate of Mercy Corps - is a group of dedicated and experienced volunteers based in Jordan who are helping recognised local charities and NGOs deal with the large influx of refugees arriving in Jordan. I saw first-hand how vital the work that HRJ does actually is.  Each week we'd sort out donations that people had given, including clothes, bedding, furniture, books, toys and other items. These would then be distributed to refugees, most of whom had fled Syria  and made their way to Jordan. HRJ doesn't only help those in the well-known Zaatari camp, but also in other areas not often covered by international media including Azraq, Mafraq and other communities. It alsoI visited Azraq and Mafraq, including a school that was being built at the time. I was greeted warmly each time and met some of the those who had escaped the Syria crisis themselves, volunteers and teachers. HRJ now also has three schools supporting over 600 kids and is still making an amazing contribution to helping refugees.Where does the money go?The money is spent on what is needed by the refugees. So that's  food, clothes, teachers, blankets, heaters, nappies and much more. As a rough idea, it costs $5 for a children's winter coat and $250  a month for a teacher's salary.100% of donations to HRJ  goes towards helping those in need. There are no overhead, executive, or administration fees.Any amount you donate will be very, very much appreciated by me, HRJ and all those who benefit from the amazing work it does.Find out more on HRJ's Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/HelpingSyrianRefugeesJordan/",https://images.gofundme.com/wygo3dnhoXM2NLnc5rk-JENeWz0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17160888_1483797494.8766.png,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17160888_1483789248.7296_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17160888_1483789279.7883_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17160888_1483789443.2585_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17160888_1483789593.755_funddescription.jpg']",4,"Created January 4, 2017",Catherine Ellis is organizing this fundraiser.,Non-Profits & Charities,"£1,620 raised of £1,500 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/rebuilding-from-toxic-mold-exposure,Rebuilding from Toxic Mold Exposure,"In May of 2016, recently married David and Mindy Heath purchased their first home.  Mindy has a 6 year old son and David and Mindy were expecting a little girl in December.  Although it was an extremely hot and dry summer they soon found themselves with various unexplained illnesses.  By July of 2016 they began to notice the house feeling damp and cool.  They also began to find their child’s belongings covered in mold.            Upon further investigation; everything in their house bore the resemblance of their sons mold laden belongings.  After purchasing a $1,500 dehumidifier in August it became apparent that the entire house was infected with mold.  David and Mindy found themselves emptying the dehumidifier bucket at least 4 to 5 times a day.  Along with that, the wallpaper and paint began to peel throughout their home.  At this time Mindy, who was 6 months pregnant, was sick daily and admitted to the hospital 4 times with dehydration.  Her 6 year old son was put on allergy and asthma medication.  He also wasn’t waking up for school which was unlike his previous behavior.  As they started tossing out anything growing mold, they began to fear that they now lived in a “sick” house.            With everything becoming worse they hired an Environmental Mold Abator to test their house.  This confirmed their fears; multiple toxic molds (black mold) were prevalent-especially in both bedrooms.  Following the mold report they were forced to move out of their home but had nowhere to go.  Because of the contamination issue with mold they were advised to discard the contents of their home. They hired an attorney who eventually had them released from the contract, but not until after their baby girl was born and without any compensation whatsoever.  Dylan and Katie (Mindy’s sister) having just purchased their first home, took them into their unfinished basement.           The week Mindy was due-the following pictures tell their story- they lost nearly everything, taking multiple dumpsters and multiple loads to the landfill.  Now still living in the basement with their children they have just begun the process of purchasing a home having to use retirement funds, but have been left with nothing to furnish the home with.  The insurance company, per usual in mold cases, denied any claim due to the fact it was a “preexisting condition.”  As of right now they are depending on their family for some basic needs, winter attire, and housing for their cats along with the few belongings they could save.So with the attorney fees, the environmental testing fees, the dumpster fees the purchasing of a dehumidifier,  article/food replacement, the missed work and loss of baby items, furnishings, appliances (small and large), clothing and accessories, toys, beds and bedding, bathroom items, area carpets, food, numerous totes of self purchased school teaching supplies (Mindy is a teacher), and brand new wedding gifts- nearly everything they owned (as can be seen by the photos)- including the cost of obtaining this house (closing cost, down payments, property/school taxes and upkeep), they now find themselves needing to turn to others for help. Any help, regardless if you find it in your heart as an amount, a  prayer or  a share would be greatly appreicated. Blessings to you...SaveSave",https://images.gofundme.com/QyYXyDX2zFskOlPQBbe5Fae91RQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17161266_1483458235.4543.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17161266_1483458678.4361_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17161266_1483458713.6019_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17161266_1483458730.0723_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17161266_1483458747.2587_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17161266_1483458762.6674_funddescription.jpg']",5,"Created January 3, 2017",Catherine Heath is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Melinda Heath.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$2,515 raised of $10,000 goal"

Dit uiteraard dankzij deze geweldige geldinzameling. Het levenswerk van Robbe is vertrokken en daar willen wij jullie enorm voor bedanken. De documentaire zal een uniek document worden over de Belgische cinema. Met nooit eerder gehoorde verhalen en getuigenissen van mensen in filmland.Ons eerste interview was met Erik van Looy, en dat was al een groot succes. Op het programma staan nog o.a. Matthias Schoenaerts, Michael Roskam, Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah, Felix van Groeningen,...Momenteel worden de oude interviews (met soms reeds gestorven iconen!) in de beste staat ingeladen voor montage, om in oktober aan de slag te kunnen gaan in de montage-kamer. Het wordt nog een hele karwei om de juist vorm en inhoud hieruit te destilleren, maar we hebben er zin in!Veel mensen vragen zich af waar dat geld nu juist naartoe gaat... Om dit project zo goed en zo snel mogelijk tot een goed einde te brengen, hebben we een zeer geëngageerd team, maar dat moet wel betaald worden om zich enkel hierop te kunnen storten: regie-assistent/co-scenarist, cameraman, geluidsman, monteur, technisch begeleider, grader, uitvoerend producent...Maar wat velen niet weten, is dat bij deze documentaire kosten komen die bij een andere niet aan de orde zijn. Een documentaire over de Belgische film kan natuurlijk niet zonder véél fragmenten uit die films. En daar staan nu eenmaal rechten op die moeten betaald worden om ze te mogen gebruiken.Er is momenteel geld genoeg om de komende maanden door te kunnen werken, maar dan volgen er moeilijke tijden met post-productie (color grading etc.) en distributie (dvd's etc.)Een bijdrage is dus nog steeds zeer welkom. En wij geven jullie daar graag in de loop van volgend jaar een spetterende film voor in de plaats.",https://images.gofundme.com/YN-SPQ25S2HwtnwBymNI5TisUYE=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9CP-to7PXag/0.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Sven Heusequin is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"€42,056 raised of €100,000 goal"

I have completed my master's degree in clinical psychology and have been working hard on my doctorate in the same. A lot of you also know that I've had major medical problems over the last few years which included several back surgeries, and a brush with death over the summer from a spinal-fluid leak and staph infection (most people didn't know that). I am finally doing better than I have been over the past few years and I am currently looking for a job so I can begin to support myself again. The problem is between now and when I can start working, I am broke and cannot afford basic things like gas for my car, food, or even rent. I have been selling any extraneous possessions of mine on Craigslist over the last few months (let me know if you want to buy some golf clubs or a shot gun!) to support myself in the interim.  This is not something I ever thought I would do, but I truly need the help to bridge the void until I can find a job. I'm on the verge of being homeless and starving and it's a pretty terrifying place to be. Unfortunately, my family just doesn't have the means to help me out anymore either.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/aniyasbabyfund,Baby Fund,"I had to start the campaign again due to some technical difficulties. Long story short- I've been out here for some time now, writing my films and minding my own business. The downward spiral started at the beginning of the summer when I lost my bar-tending job because I stood up to a supervisor who was harassing me in extremely forward ways, like demanding sexual favors in exchange for shifts and so on- but when you're not from here and working ""off the books"" they don't give you a leg to stand on - so I was thrown out like a cat and fired via a text message... The nightmare continued when I found out the person I was paying rent to wasn't my legal landlord and had no rights to the space I was renting from him- the whole building was shut down and evicted due to many health and safety violations and I ended up homeless along with all the other tenants. Every single one of us was either from out of town or elderly, so it was just a scam to take advantage of vulnerable people. I went to court and was given a program for housing, however not many landlords seem to accept it- so I haven't had a safe space for just over two months now, but I'm still looking and not giving up hope... Amongst all this happening, in the middle of the summer, I found out I became pregnant, while I was told time and time again that it wouldn't ever be a possibility throughout my entire 20s, so it was quite the shock but definitely also a miracle. It's been a very difficult pregnancy, and medical help is very limited to me, to make matters worse I haven't been allowed to get onto any flights by the very same doctors that have often refused me treatment, so I can't come back to London and this whole thing feels like a really twisted and unfair catch 22. The money from the first campaign went on getting together all the paperwork and paying for attorney fees in order to get married so now I have a little more security here, and I'm extremely grateful to all who contributed and supported. I'm due at the end of February so time is getting close... Any donations to this campaign will go on getting my hospital bag together, a private scan and consultation so I can get some medical advice and baby essentials. I've been warned that I could be charged up to $35.000 to give birth here in NYC but hopefully things will fall into place and I will get some kind of insurance, but I may not. Being homeless and pregnant really takes a toll on you, mentally and physically, so I'm trying my hardest to keep myself together and keep my sanity. Through all this I learned that all you can do is keep praying and stay on track, but sometimes life throws weird curve balls at us, and admittedly I need some support. I wish I could have a baby shower and invite you all, but for now this is all I can do...

One of the guys went downstairs to get something, and discovered smoke and a smoke detector going off. He looked into the room that was billowing smoke, and saw the room engulfed in flames.He ran back upstairs to wake the sleeping brother, warn everyone else to get out, and then called 911. They grabbed a few items and ran out. By the time they got out front, there was black smoke pouring out the first floor of the house. Thankfully, there were no injuries, other than the unfortunate loss of a pet.THE NEEDPreliminary estimates from a loss specialist associated with the city are that the property will require six months of rehab work before anyone can live there. The loss of the chapter house is a huge concern, but the bigger concern of this campaign is for the residents that are displaced.  There are six, plus the chapter.Dylan Hoffman had a total loss to the fire.  Two brothers/roommates live on the same floor with him and have smoke/water damage and significant loss, and three more live on the second floor where smoke permeated everything. Loss is unknown on the second floor as yet.- All six residents of the house are displaced. That means apartment hunting, moving, security deposits, etc. for six people.    - Dylan's room was gutted and is a total loss. This included lots of clothes, his bed and other furniture, his TV, his MacBook Pro laptop, his stereo, his books and other school items, and his girlfriend's laptop. ($3K-$5K)   - The kitchen was completely burned up. The other two bedrooms and living room have significant water, fire, and smoke damage to them. Some furniture, clothing and other contents will be a total loss with some possibility of recovery and rehab for some items. ($ Unknown)- Above the first floor, damage is largely limited to smoke, which permeated everything. Things are covered with soot, and couches, chairs, and mattresses all smell from the blaze. Clothing will require special cleaning to remove the smell and the residue. (Restoration $ Unknown)- The damage to the basement is unknown at this time, but it's estimated that the washer and dryer will require replacing, and everything in storage down there will need to be thrown away due to water.- I'm sure more items will come up over time.Without digging very deeply, we have at minimum $10,000 in material losses and expenses associated with this fire. I will update the campaign as more specfic information comes in.Contributions will be prioritized for Dylan and rest of the brothers with the significant personal losses coming first.With six guys displaced, we have an immediate need for some funding, so please move quickly and contribute if you can. School is starting in a few weeks, and we have guys that lost the bulk of their clothing in the blaze, plus school books, laptops, etc.If you have other methods to help, such as furniture, bedding, etc. please feel free to reach out to me directly at Tom@PhiSigMilwaukee.comThank you all very much!Tom WrightChapter Advisor",https://images.gofundme.com/fSIZ0kpKG3GZjZnl0WgO-4WYuVg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17162256_1483471534.4604.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Thomas Wright is organizing this fundraiser.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$4,565 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mamas-fighting-cancer,Mama's Fighting Cancer,"Lessons From my Mama 1.)  Be a lion when you love; furiously & loyally.2.)  Laugh out loud. Snort if you must.3.)  Run barefoot.4.)  Pick wildflowers for your hair.5.)  Cook with wine.6.)  Be patient with love & painting (both of which can be exasperating).7.)  Let your imagination run wild.8.)  Grow gardens.9.)  Don’t be afraid to make an ass out of yourself if it will make someone you love laugh or smile—or maybe they will just look at you like “you dumb bastard” but you know that they can’t help but to love you.10.)  Be colorful11.)  Stand by your convictions12.)  Live with honor & integrity13.)     You can say fuck, shit or damn but don’t take the lords name in vain—also, one must not say aloud “fart”.14.)  Believe in magic—wish on stars, look for fairies—know that miracles do happen.15.) Know that you—YOU!—are pretty fucking amazing!16.)  Sing when you want to.17.)  Dream as big as you want—there isn’t a damn thing in this world that we can’t accomplish if we work for it & believe in it & ourselves.18.)  Suffer for beauty19.) Own the room, you little vixen!20.)    Be kind.21.)   A smile is such a simple thing to give & it can change the course of the world.22.)  Pull furniture away from the wall just a bit—it will make the room appear larger.23.)  Wear sexy underwear. That little boost in confidence goes a long way.24.)  Show some manners, damn it!25.)  Keep hold of your innocence. It is your magic.26.)  Be a badass; know how to use power tools  & put hardwood floors in.27.)  Don’t be afraid to ask for help.28.) Be there for those you love. No matter what.29.)  Live in the moment.  Taste every flavor. Laugh when you can, cry when you must.  Let the wild animal that you are really live.30.)  Say I love you often & you bloody well mean it!31.)   And now that Cancer is here, She’s teaching me how to fight. How to fight for love. To fight for adventure. She’s fighting for opportunity. Hell, she’s fighting her own body—the very ribs that hold her heart. And she is doing it with such grace. Such power and resolve.  She’s fighting with every breath and that is the greatest lesson of all: we fight to live; we fight to love-because we damn well deserve it.  If you know my Mama, you know that she is a wild woman full of so much love and life.  In October she was hit with Breast Cancer and it's knocked the wind out of all of us.  She had surgery to remove the cancer cells 6 weeks ago and now she will begin chemo only to follow that with radiation and 5 years of ""cocktails"".  Alisha, Drew and I are setting all our pennies aside to help pay for the many days where she won't be able to work, the daily commutes to Seattle and what Mom is most pushing for, to save her hair.  After much research, the rebel that is our mother, discovered a recently FDA approved process to help keep that wild mane of black atop her head. It's called Penguin Caps that essentially freeze her hair follicles so that the Chemo doesn't kill them. Alisha and I will go to each and every Chemo appointment to tightly pile dry ice within these caps every twenty minutes four hours before and after her appointments.  It's certainly a process, but knowing that we can help give our mom this one victory--to face herself in the mirror and not see sickness--is something that we'd go to the ends of the earth for.  Simply put, we know things are tight financially for everyone, give what you can-even if it's a note telling her that she's got this. Stop by, give her a hug.  Thank you for all your love and support. VIVA REBECCA DICKINSON!!!P.S.

I, Victor Wowk, was diagnosed with Grade 2 Chondrosarcoma, a very rare type of cancer affecting the bones and soft tissue. I was told by my doctors the chemotherapy and radiation that is given here locally would not help this type of rare cancer. After many tests and a surgery, I went to Boston for Proton and Photon radiation. After 2 months of treatment I returned home. In November I had followed up with my local doctor. After many more tests we had learned that the cancer has reoccurred and is rapidly growing. Even though the doctors are not optimistic we are hopeful for the best. I am now beginning a special type of strong chemotherapy for this rare type of cancer. There is only one type of chemotherapy that has just been recently approved by the FDA, called Lartruvo, that doctors recommend to help shrink the tumors and stop them from multiplying. I am the first person in Michigan to have this new chemotherapy administered. So I am reaching out to my friends because this drug is very expensive and is not yet covered by insurance due to the review process that takes time.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/tracys-medical-support-brace,Tracy's medical support brace,"My name is Tracy. I was born with Cerebral Palsy that effects the left side of my body. I had several surgeries to correct my restricted Achilles tendon. A few years ago after two more attempts to help my constant pain while walking, I ended up with a severe infection that caused me to lose my tendon entirely. I was placed on a vacuum that helped to clear out my infection while the vacuum worked to pull my wound together again. After this process I ended up with severe scar tissue on the back of my ankle. Walking is painful and my fall risk is high. I have tried all the traditional AFO braces, but the hard backing always causes severe pain to my scar. I am asking for your help because they have a new silicone brace that my doctors and physical therapists have recommended but my medical insurance refuses to pay for it. The silicone supports my ankle, reduces my risk of injury and it does not rub or hurt my scar in any way. Please help me by funding my out of pocket expenses for this wonderful new brace that is truly going to not only support my injured ankle, but most importantly improve my quality of life. Many thanks to anyone who is willing to help.

Moments heureux en famille, on se souhaite santé et bonheur. Ces souhaits que l’on fait souvent machinalement ont pourtant une signification très importante. Pour une jeune famille; Joanie, Luc, Elsa 2ans et Arthur 4 mois, la nouvelle année ne s’est pas déroulée comme ils espéraient. Le 31 décembre au matin, Elsa se réveille mal en point; fièvre, visage enflé, teint pâle… Ses parents morts d’inquiétude face aux multiples symptômes qui s’emparent de leur princesse depuis quelque temps se rendent à l’hôpital pour finalement apprendre une terrible nouvelle qui viendra chambouler leur vie. Le 1er janvier 2017, les mots que des parents ne devraient jamais entendre de la bouche d’un médecin ont retenti avec un écho lourd et amer; leucémie... cancer. Une leucémie s’est emparée du corps de leur grande fille.La vie les avait déjà mis à l’épreuve avec leur nouvelle maison puisqu’au moment de faire une rénovation mineure dans une pièce pour y installer leur nouveau-né, ils ont découvert de la moisissure dans les murs. Les travaux se sont avérés majeurs et l’argent nécessaire n’étant pas présent afin d’effectuer les réparations, la pièce fut donc condamné le temps d’obtenir les finances nécessaire. L’état de santé d’Elsa étant maintenant plus fragile, ils seront dans l’obligation d’effectuer les travaux plus rapidement que prévu. Plusieurs jours à l’hôpital et de nombreux traitements plus tard, Elsa retournera à la maison et devra réintégrer un milieu sain puisqu’elle sera plus vulnérable à toute infection. En plus, de tous les frais occasionnés par les multiples déplacements à Ste-Justine afin de recevoir les soins requis, les parents devront diminuer considérablement leurs heures de travail pour être présents auprès d’Elsa et sans oublier leur petit Arthur.Nous vous lançons un cri du cœur afin de venir en aide à cette famille.Chaque dollar fera une différence.Tous ensembles pour Elsa",https://images.gofundme.com/-eQNLwu07l4_PS2oczRkooYVJYg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17163238_1483474760.0822.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Vicky et Christine is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$7,325 raised of $20,000 goal"

He is a courageous man and has been protecting our community for 18 years as a law enforcement officer. He is a loving loyal husband to me, Kristin Austin, and together we have 5 amazing children ages 11-5. Chris was diagnosed with two types of thyroid cancer on December 28, 2016. He has two category lV Malignant Papillary Carcinoma nodules (one attached to a lymph node), one Hurthle Cell nodule with A-Typical Cells category lll and one nodule with A-Typical Cells category lll. He will be having a complete removal of his thyroid gland and surrounding tissues on January 30, 2017. Chris is our main source of income. He will be off work for 3-4 weeks for the surgery. After the surgery we will find out if he needs Radioactive Iodine treatment &/or Chemotherapy. We know he potentially could be off work another 2 weeks to 6 months depending on treatment required. The help and support of living expenses for the next few months will help Chris not stress at how the daily bills will be paid and make sure there is food on the table for our family. He will need a stress free environment to heal quickly so he can return to doing what he loves, protecting our family, you and your loved ones.￼Thyroid awareness is so important. More then 30 million Americans have thyroid disorders, and more then half go undiagnosed and untreated. Thyroid disease is more common then diabetes and heart disease. In fact, more Americans suffer from thyroid disease then all types of cancer combined. It's more common in women then men. Chris's only symptoms were fatigue and lack of weight loss. He has been on a fairly strict diet and is at the gym 4-6 days a week. I knew with that alone his thyroid was in question. I know that 80% of nodules are benign. I never expected my husband to be in the 20%. With the surgery and treatments thyroid cancer is 99% curable. That is great news for our family. Chris knows this isn't a death sentence. He knows that he will fight with all he has and he will prevail!￼We are asking for prayers for his speedy recovery and total health restored. If your able to financially help no amount is too small. We thank all of you from the bottom of our hearts. Please help me spread the word by sharing Chris's campaign.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-heal-her-heart,Help Heal her Heart,"It shouldn’t be this hard.  The phrase that was uttered over and over through multiple surgeries and medical procedures for the last 6 months. With many more months of recovery to still face, it is our time to all rally together to make the fight easier for our friend Shelley and start 2017 the right way for her. Which leads you here to this GoFundMe page. First, thanks for stopping by. Now, please take the time to read her story and help any way you can. We all know Shelley to be the first person to lend a hand to others so let us return the favor. On June 15th Shelley was rushed to the hospital with a shortness of breath. She was diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and she was in heart failure. She needed Open Heart Surgery to cut down the muscle growth and allow the blood to flow correctly through her body. They said, even though it was Open Heart surgery, it was a simple surgery to fix a genetic problem. The doctor promised once it was done she would notice a difference in how wonderful she would feel. Well after the surgery, she didn’t feel wonderful at all. In fact, she was worse and came out of the surgery with a heart block and needed to be rushed into surgery two days later to have a permanent pacemaker put in. Once she was released from the hospital after these two surgeries, she was not recovering or healing and actually getting worse. She returned to the ER to find out she had a hole in her heart – most likely cause by the first surgery and was never corrected while she was still in the operating room. After months of being studied like a guinea pig by multiple surgeons, it was determined the only solution was a second Open heart surgery. For months, she remained in heart failure, dealing with pain, complications and multiple procedures to make sure she was healing so she could go back and do it all over again. Can you imagine spending months trying to heal, knowing you were only healing to do it all over again? No one should have to go through that, especially when it was someone else’s fault. The worse part was, after consulting several attorneys, there does not seem to be any legal recourse or compensation that could be claimed for this botched surgery (or as it became known to the nursing staff, “the hack job”). Shelley missed months of work but right back into full time as soon as she could to try to make up for loss money. However, 2016 still remained a struggle with excess medical bills, home repairs, a water leak causing major damage at her rental property, tenants that had to be evicted and of course regular monthly and daily expenses. She had to take money out of her retirement fund to help herself before returning the the next surgery. She returned to the hospital in December for the 2nd open heart surgery and is now home trying to recover from her chest being sawed open for the second time this year. Shelley stood her ground though and fought her way through all of it. But now 2017 seems to be starting as daunting as 2016. She will be starting the year in pain and out of work while also starting an unexpected journey as a single Mommy. She still has a mortgage and monthly expenses to pay, while also facing new insurance deductibles, pricey exams, medicines and whatever surprises 2017 hands her, all while not being able to work.We all know what a hard worker Shelley is and how hard she has worked for everything she has. She is not one to ask for help but it is time we all offer the help without her having to ask. Let’s make 2017 a great year for our friend.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/buchanan-birth-twins,Buchanan Birth (Twins!),"My name is Hunter Buchanan, My  wife is Kenia Buchanan (Cortes Jimenez). My wife and I are missionaries here in the states. We were recently married and after a few months we conceived our first child. Since we didn't qualify for any health insurance we were going to have a natural birth to help cover expenses. When we went in for our level 2 ultrasound we were blessed to find out we now have twin little girls. They were also diagnosed to be Monochorionic and Mono-amniotic which means they share the same sac and placenta. In short, the doctor explained this is the rarest form of twins (0.05% chance) and also the most dangerous and expensive since at 26 weeks she will have to be monitored and/or hospitalized everyday until the C-section at 32 weeks where the babies will be under intense care for at least a month. With Kenia as a missionary at One7 (www.one7.org) and myself at Silent Images (www.silentimages.org) we financially meet the requirements of Medicare or something similar, but since Kenia is the one delivering and she is not a citizen or green card holder we are not qualified. Kenia is legally here on a work visa that we have to renew every two years, which is quite expensive. We are in the process of getting her status change to obtain a green card but this could take as long as two years before approved. Unfortunately because of her type of visa she is unable to get any health insurance or assistance from the hospital. We are on the waiting list for humanitarian medicaid but if approved will only cover the delivery and not the other bills of being seen at the hospital daily leading up to the C-section. Each time we go into the hospital they charge us $1154.40. We were told that by the end of our pregnancy the bills could get up to $100,000 due to the fact that Kenia will have to be monitored everyday and the babies being in the EQ for so long.We know that God provides for his children and our faith is strong that He is sovereign over everything. It is a miracle that our girls have defied the odds. We are excited for how God will use theses little girls to make His name known.

Past and future donors, your contributions mean a lot to us. We have not ended our Town Hall campaign just yet.

We want to go from commitment to action plans, and then to action! Together we will shift narratives, framing practices, policies, resources and culture, and build power! We will close the campaign after one of two things happen. (1) The 24th comes...and goes and/or (2) we reach our orginal goal of  raising $5,000,--money we still need in order to pay outstanding Town Hall bills! :-) Of course, we'd love to see the best of both possible worlds collide: the 24th comes and goes and $5,000 breaks our bank on the day or before it arrives!Could you please help us?

We are so grateful.Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KRB8DHR82c&feature=youtu.beWhere the campaign began:Below is our video to kick-start our GoFundMe. Preferably please watch after reading through this page, but otherwise- enjoy the rap! :-)Link to video: https://youtu.be/xiQYEAcATH8Setting up this account was very difficult for me.  I have always tried to take care of Kierra's needs on my own.  Unfortunately, I have gotten in over my head in medical expenses for her and am in need of financial help for Kierra.  In July I had surgery, as a result I have developed CRPS. This is a chronic, progressive disease that debilitates my sympathetic nervous system. I am still an employee of Riverside Hospital, but currently on long term disability with little income.  At this point I am unable to keep up financially with all of Kierra's medical expenses as I try to also pay my own.  It is hard to ask for help.......as we start this new year- we are in debt over $20,000 just in medical bills and our deductable now has started over. This means we are without full medical coverage until another $6,700 is spent towards Kierra's care. I am very grateful to Riverside Hospital for putting our account on hold until March, and CHKD for always working with us.  We are currently applying for a secondary insurance and SSD.  But that takes time, is not guaranteed, and leaves us without much help to get out of the pool of medical debt Kierra is swimming in.  I am praying for a spinal cord stimulator, so I can get back to work soon and provide more help for Kierra.  But until then.........I am very humbly asking for financial help, no matter what size the donation. Kierra's only wish at this point is to finish her Senior year at CNU.  Even if you are unable to donate, please pass on the site, send a few prayers our way, and if you could, please read my daughters story below.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and below is the story she wrote herself.  I am praying that Kierra's life will be a long and happy one.  She is my rock, my inspiration and my heart.Kierra Lee Bumble Bee- Im gonna stand by you!To better understand what Kierra is and has gone through....Watch the movie Miracles from Heaven.  It is so close to our story- minus the Miracle....but is coming....Our God can move Mountains!____________________________________________________Kierra's post:I have asked all my friends, peers, and family to take a few minutes to read through some of the most personal aspects of my life right now that I share with reservation. If you know me, you know being serious is not my best trait, which is why in addition to what I’m about to share my mom and I made a rap video to summarize. (The link is at the top of this page)To start my post, I figured I’d joke that while most women like to match their bra to their underwear, I now prefer to match my nose tube to my ostomy :-) (See pic)Last month I hit a point in my life in which I endearingly refer to as rock bottom. For those of you unaware, I was born with a rare, incurable genetic disease called mitochondrial disease. Most all diagnosed as a child die before their pre-teen years. I was given until 13. Those who live past have an average life expectancy of 49. HOWEVER, I got an A in statistics sophomore year so I feel qualified to reject current medical stats as I plan to live to be 100. Most all of my friends from CNU only know me as a healthy ray of energy and smiles. I actually have only experienced 5 years of my life (age 16-20) in good health. Before 16, I spent most all my life surviving off feeding tubes, mediports, full-time home health care nurses, cyber school, hospital livin’ and lots of wheelchairin’. I recently spent 5 years of my life thinking that my illness was magically “cured” and that I would never again face the fear of losing the life I worked so hard to have. In the past year my disease started to manifest once again like a big fat meanie, one organ at a time. My mom and I actually wasted months convinced that a pituitary tumor found last Feb. was the reason I was becoming so ill. We were just too scared to believe my disease was doing this to me again. As a side note, the tumor is benign and the little bugger is still in my brain and Ive named him Ralph.Recently, my mom and I hopelessly drove to Pittsburgh, PA to be seen by the nation's #1 doctor in mitochondrial disorders. He gave a little more insight, hopes to partake in a clinical trial soon, AND even found a heart murmur while performing his basic assessment (Bonus!!!)So, this is where I am currently at:1.) In November I got a glamorous ostomy button, allowing me to work my large intestine from the outside since it kinda sucks (sorry colon no hard feelings)2.) In December, a nasojejunal tube placed. This goes in my nose, down my throat, past my stomach, and into my small intestine to provide the most direct form of nutrition a person can possibly receive. I can’t really eat by mouth anymore, but you can blame my stomach for that one.3.) The game of connect-the-dots across my abdomen (see pic) are from previous feeding tubes that provided a more permanent form of nutrition than a nose tube can. I might get another soon, I might not.. who knows!Currently I am working as hard as I can to get healthy again with the help of all my kool new tools. I’m not one to provide public updates on my life because I don’t care for the unavoidable sympathy response, as nice as the gestures are. However, this year it's time to stop hiding and denying my illness, it's time to ask for help, and it's time to be thankful for everything I am so blessed with, regardless the struggle.P.S.If you're reading this and have any cool connections for post-grads with a BS in Cellular Biology/Chemistry.. feel free to reach out!! My genetic doctor broke the news to me in October that my body could never sustain the physiological stress that accompanies my dream of medical school. In addition, this series of unfortunate events has prevented me from pursuing a graduate program at this time. I still hope to find a job in the biomedical field after I graduate- something until I figure out where I belong and become healthy enough to get there.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/momlisa,Mom Lisa and her son Matthew,"Our beloved head cook Mom Lisa Daniels received word last night that her son Matthew Wetzel had passed. Lisa is a faithful servant to the boys at Cameron Boys Camp. We serve youth who are striving at a second chance at success in school, family and life. Lisa encourages all at camp through great meals and smiles. She is an example of hard work, dedication and sacrifice. The passing of her son was unexpected and a shock. She showed up today to cook for the boys and the staff and is handling all the necessaries of this emergency while taking care of others.Matthew suffered from siezures and it is believed that this is what caused his death. Because of unexpected nature of his passing there is a need to help cover medical costs, get Matthew home from Florida and prepare for a memorial service. Matthew was a funny individual with his own way of living life. He loved hiking and found peace while out on the Trail. He was in process of completing the AT and had hiked many sections already spending almost 5 months on the trail. Matthews’s sense of humor, kindness, thoughtfulness about life and creativity will be missed by his friends and family.Everyone here at camp is grateful for Mom Lisa and are burdened with her loss and pain. It is so hard to experience the loss of a child especially unexpectedly. We cannot even imagine trying to arrange all of the details needed during this time and to come up with the finances needed to carry out those plans. It would bring us great joy if we were able to help Mom Lisa bear the burden of these expenses so that she can concentrate on taking care of her family and celebrating the memory of her son.

For those that aren't as familiar, here's a quick breakdown. I have been following Jesus for 8 years now and I first started following HIM midway through my college days at University of Arizona. God has taken me to various uncomfortable environments with the purpose of expanding the Kingdom of God. This opportunity is the first that would take me overseas.  I want to be used by Him in any way that I can so this opportunity is HUGE to me. I have had the opportunity to encounter over 500 people across the nation in various states & help expand the love of God. After embarking on mission trips across the United States over the past 4 years, my desire to serve a community overseas has grown. GOALS: My purpose for this trip would be that God would greatly deepen my affinity for HIM & HIM alone through this trip. That relationships would be birthed with people that my heart would always remember. That lastly upon my return, my gratefulness would be stirred to better appreciate all the commodities that I have access to in the United States.WHY: I prayed about the possibility of going on this trip.  It was clear the Lord was telling me to go. I checked my school schedule and this trip coincided with my grad school spring break. I asked for the days off from work, and it was  graciously accepted. I obtained my passport & now the next step is to raise the support!!! SUPPORT: I need to raise a total of $2,250. $750 by January 7th 10 a.m. central time, another $750 by February 7th 10 a.m. and the last $750 by March 7th 10 a.m.",https://images.gofundme.com/gImTkN6MNFRQHUIfc6JzlqtnK3c=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17164122_1483463242.0999.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Victor Yates is organizing this fundraiser.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$2,350 raised of $2,250 goal"

As an entrepreneur and avid sportsman, I approach work—and life in general—as a hugely rewarding adventure.   My love of motorcycle racing has given me a deep respect for the fine line between risk and payoff. My next challenge: DAYTONA 200, a 57-lap, 200-mile race on the 3.51-mile road course of Daytona International Speedway, sanctioned by the American SportBike Racing Association (ASRA), March 18th 2017. The funds will be used to prep the bike, gear, registration, training, marketing and secure professional video, photography and everything needed to document this challenge.   The reason behind: to prove the true power of will, that despite age, challenges or level of difficulty, we can conquer even our biggest fear. I can't promise a podium, but I will promise to put up a true fight completing it.   I spent a lifetime setting up goals, pushing the limits, leaving a mark wherever I can, for generations to come.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/new-truck-for-orphanage,New Truck for Orphanage,"Baan San Fan is an orphanage that was started after the 2004 Tsunami hit Thailand. Sam and Gai, husband and wife, opened the orphanage in October of 2005 to house 8 children who were devastated by the tsunami. Baan San Fan now has kids ranging from high school to elementary school - some without families & some with unable parents due to drugs or finances. Since the Thai government will not support any non-profit organizations, Gai and Sam receive zero money from grants or funding. The two are also recents converts to Christianity, so most of the funding they were receiving has no longer continues since most non-Christian Thai citizens refuse to provide support (over 98%). The children are not forced to practice Christianity, but the orphanage does provide opportunitites for them to explore/expand their faith. BSF derives most of its income from selling organic eggs and chickens to resorts and restaurants in the popular tourist area of Phuket, about 3 hours drive away. Unfortunately, the orphanage's aging truck was in an accident and while no one was seriously injured, the loss of the vehicle is devastating to the orphanage and puts this wonderful haven at risk of closure. I will be visiting Baan San Fan towards the end of January and would love NOTHING more than to provide them with a check for the remainder of the amount they are needing for a new truck.

Sean passed away over the holidays, due to complications following surgery. Sean spent the past 13 years working at Gale Force Nine. He was instrumental in the creation and design of the GF9 Board Game range including:Spartacus: A Game of Blood & TreacheryFirefly: the GameSons of Anarchy: Men of MayhemHomelandWWE: Superstar ShowdownFamily Guy: Stewie’s Sexy PartyStar Trek: Ascendancy, and beyond.   Sean spent his life immersed in Science Fiction and Fantasy worlds. In the early 1990s, he founded his own game store, Omnidon’s, in Hummelstown PA.  Before joining GF9, Sean worked for Games Workshop for four years, including manning the Battlewagon and running the Maryland Battle Bunker.At his core, Sean was a story teller. He loved telling stories. His preferred method of telling stories was through imaginative game play. Sean wanted to make thematic games that told stories, games in which people could immerse themselves in the world that his games were built around. Sean succeeded many times over, helping to craft some amazing board games based on some of the most popular and iconic entertainment properties in the world. Sean was incredibly proud of his work, and rightly so. If you ever asked Sean which game was his favorite, he would say it was the one he was currently working on.Sean was a close friend to those around him. If you were lucky enough to know Sean, you knew he was passionate about board games, video games, books, movies and the creative process that made these things great. The only thing that Sean loved more than gaming was his brilliant daughter Alyssa. As Sean said many times in the few weeks before his passing, ""Alyssa is my rock. She keeps me going.""This Gofundme campaign in Sean's memory is for his daughter Alyssa. She was with him at the end. Losing any family member can be overwhelming. Losing your father unexpectedly the day after Christmas is heartbreaking. In addition to the final expenses and hospital bills Sean left behind, he was also Alyssa's main support for her living and education expenses. The tuition bills are coming due and money is going to be tight. Alyssa is an amazing student and Sean wanted nothing more than for her to focus 110% on her education and future. With Sean's passing, anything we can do to help her financially carry on in these sad times would be most appreciated. There are many of us that want Alyssa to move forward and become the person Sean knew she could to be.Thank you all for your support!",https://images.gofundme.com/XigNtqwnxtHTimJRFqKjjt-vjRI=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17164224_1483478180.6002.png,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",John Kovaleski is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Alyssa Sweigart.,Funerals & Memorials,"$6,220 raised of $10,000 goal"

For the past week he's been bushwhacking a trail through Peru, but yesterday he was forced to abandon his trip when his backpack was carried away during a river crossing. I understand that he found his way back to town freezing, hungry, and homeless. I'm relieved that he's safe, but this is still a very serious setback for him since his backpack contained more or less everything he owned. My brother works seasonal jobs and saves up for half the year to be able to afford not to work during the off-season, but I also know him to be extremely frugal and during this time of the year he lives out of his tent and carries everything on his back. This isn't a vacation, this is just how he lives; sacrificing comfort in exchange for a cheap (but different / interesting) lifestyle. Personally I think it's really brave.In addition to his (very sentimental) backpack, he also lost his tent, sleeping bag & pad, laptop, passport, wallet, and DSLR camera full of pictures, as well as innumerable little things that are necessary for surviving out of one's backpack (water filter, camp stove, first aid kit, etc). My mom and I are trying to keep him fed and housed while he's still abroad, but without the four essentials (pack, tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad) he won't be able to continue with his current plans to camp out while looking for a seasonal job in Kauai (an area far away from any friends, family, or other resources). He already has the plane ticket, but after yesterday he's lacking every other tool he needs to make this happen.I'm really proud of my brother and don't want him to have to bail, and I know he has a great network of friends who feel the same way. I've started this fundraiser to try to replace his essentials:Backpack - ULA Circuit ($235)Tent - MSR Hubba NX ($350)Sleeping bag - Sea to Summit Trek TkI  ($250)Sleeping pad - Therm-a-rest NeoAir XTherm ($200)Please consider donating (or sharing this link) if you're a friend of my brother's, he can make a small amount go a long way.Thanks!Jimmy Swanbeck",https://images.gofundme.com/IevX0WM85Mwm8TD5tTyiaiu9bXo=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17164472_1483462828.5787.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Jimmy Swanbeck is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Michael Swanbeck.,Celebrations & Events,"$1,865 raised"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mctyresmiraclefund,McTyre's Miracle Fund,"My name is Danny O'Keefe and I'm raising money for my life long best friend, Zack McTyre.  Zack was born with a congenital heart condition called Transposition of the Great Arteries.   In short, its a condition where the two main arteries leaving Zack's heart were reversed.  This changed the way blood circulated throughout his body, leaving him with a shortage of oxygenated blood.  Immediately, Zack underwent open heart surgery in order to reroute the blood flow, leaving him with better oxygenation but still mediocre heart function.Ultimately, Zack needed a heart transplant and as of December 2016 he was admitted to Emory Hospital in Atlanta.  His heart function has decreased so severly that he has had to resign from his job and he has become a full time resident at Emory until he receives a new heart.  Unfortunately, the medications to keep his heart pumping until that time were not effective, so on January 3, 2017 he underwent another extensive open heart surgery to install an RVAD.  The RVAD will help pump his heart for him until he receives a heart transplant.At home, Zack's wonderful wife Addie and their six-month old little boy, Wesley, are doing their best to manage this difficult time.  In addition to caring for Wes, Addie has recently returned to full-time work following her maternity leave.  The purpose for raising this money for Zack and his family is to help with the extensive medical bills following his procedures and hospital stay.  In addition, your donations will help fund home-cooked meals for Addie and Wes as she does not have the ability to do so while working full time and single-handedly caring for an infant.Any donation you are able to make means the world to these three amazing people.  A saved trip to the store for daipers or a meal delivered means a little extra visiting time at the hospital or an hour of extra sleep for an overextended mother and wife.  Please do whatever you can to make this terribly difficult situation a little bit more bearable for this family who means so much to so many.

He's an amazing brother; he raised us, taught me everything I needed to know growing up. Our dad died and mom always worked. This guy has always worked since he was knee high. He joined the army at 17 right after 9/11, did 3 tours Infantry! He's seen the worst of humanity, survived it and came home 8 years later.  He was shot, his motorcade was blown up and Still came home! This guy is a Beast! He's also an Amazing father. He has 3 amazing kids ages 16, 13, & 3.He got married again to the love of his life and just brought another beautiful baby boy into this world just 6 weeks ago, making 4 awesome kids. David has never ever stopped working not once, never been a bum, never asked for hand outs from the government, despite being a disabled Vet. When I say he's a beast, I mean it! 2016 brought many blessings, but with that came some hardships. In the last 4 weeks he was in 2 car accidents. The first, he was rear ended by a Mustang (on her cell phone) totaling his Truck and more importantly, crushing his neck. His discs in his c spine are all ruptured and herniated. He is awaiting surgery. Among other things he had to scramble to get another vehicle for his family. He did and 2 weeks later was again hit! He Never complains, despite being in pain. He still provides for his family. Which brings me to last night 1/2/17David was asked for a ride by a friend. Of  course he obliged because he's that friend who gives. Last night when he dropped of his friend to an apartment, he was ambushed by an unknown pos criminal. This pos put a gun to my brother's head and pulled the trigger! By God's grace the first shot didn't go off, he turned to run. The pos gunman then unloaded his gun, hitting my brother 4 times! This is real. This happened to my brother, the greatest man I have ever known..When I got the call I drove straight to him. I found my brother with bullet holes in his arm, shoulder, the middle of his chest and worst his face. He was covered head to toe in the darkest blood I have ever seen. The er doctors all said he was the luckiest man there. The police, the detectives, the staff all said it was a miracle he was not only alive but talking. There is no reason he should be alive right now but he is because he's a freaking beast! Because God willed him! Because if The war couldn't kill him, no pos on the east side could!This should have been a homicide, but thank God it wasn't. It doesn't change the facts. After a tough  night in ICU, My brother pulled through and will now be in recovery. He's had facial reconstruction, he's got bullet holes thru his body that should've killed him. To say he's had a bad string of luck would be a colossal understatement. My brother deserves So much more than this! He would never ask for anything. Never. But fact is he has 4 beautiful children and a wife to take care of, and I know him, he'll be trying to goto work as soon as he can. I humbly ask for any help for my brother. He has cared for me in the same manor he's cared for his children. He would fight fiercely to be with his family the same way he did for his country, for every one of us.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/munjoy-hill-apt-building-fire,Munjoy Hill Apt. Building Fire,"Many are aware of the fire which took place January 2nd near the corners of Merrill Street and Cumberland Avenue, displacing several neighborhood families. The fire has destroyed completely or in part, two multi-unit buildings. We were aware of it immediately and by early morning were coordinating efforts to be ready to assist where we can as a neighborhood organization. Approximately 38 individuals, most of them immigrant families living below the Federally established poverty live, were left homeless by this fire. Each of these individuals were housed approximately 200 yards from our own office which has added to our need and desire to help with temporary housing, food, clothing and medicines. Many of the families received small amounts from the American Red Cross, most of which are now exhausted, and we continue to supply most with food and assistance in finding temporary or permanent shelter. They're our neighbors and friends and all were left even more vulnerable by last week's fire. 100% of these funds will be distributed evenly amongst all 38 individuals with parents receiving the equal assistance amount for each child. Our Board of Directors approved this approach earlier this week and we have publicly committed to using all funds to split amongst the victims of the fire.  We will be transferring all funds into our bank account to be used as directed by our Board of Directors, which is to divide the total amount received (after GoFundMe fees are assessed), to add the divided amount to 38 prepaid cash cards provided by our Organization's bank and to distribute those prepaid cards to the individuals.This campaign was created by the Munjoy Hill Neighborhood organization. We are a near four-decade old neighborhood organization based at 92 Congress St., Portland, ME 04101. In addition to acting as general advocates for and on behalf of one of Maine's most historic communities, we provide social outreach services within the portfolio of our community work. Those programs include a senior assistance/aging-in-place service branded as AtHome on Munjoy Hill, a senior winter shoveling response team, financial support of The LockerProject, a local program assisting food at-risk children, along with other services to at-risk or challenged residents of Portland's East End Community. Our leadership is comprised of a 13-member Board of Directors.

Recent events lead to Bruno being diagnosed with cancer. Bruno recently underwent surgery to remove what they thought was an abscessed tooth, Bruno’s primary vet did think it was an abscessed tooth because it almost looked like the tooth was knocked out somehow but still hanging on.  The surgery was meant to remove the tooth which lead to removal of 3 teeth and what they found was a tumor and took a biopsy of the tumor. Bruno’s vet referred Joey and Ginette to bring Bruno to BluePearl Veterinary Hospital as they are more advanced and could better help them with getting the tumor diagnosed and removed. Joey and Ginette brought Bruno there and learned the tumor was cancer, and Bruno needed to now have a CT scan and multiple tests to determine if the cancer has spread to his lymph nodes or lungs. Bad news was the tumor was cancer but the good news was that it hadn’t spread. Bruno is scheduled to have surgery the morning of Tuesday 1/3/17. The surgeon will not know how big the tumor is being it is in the front of his little squishy face. The tumor will take a portion of Bruno’s upper jaw and may cause his eye to have to be removed. There is a possibility Bruno may undergo radiation as well. Although Ginette and Joey have fully expected to take on any expenses needed to get Bruno to a clean bill of health, I would like to ask for help to off-set some of the costs they have and will need to pay for to get Bruno back on his feet. Here’s where the money is going to go to so far. 1st appt: $2501st Surgery and biopsy: $1,200CT Scan at Specialist: $1,700Surgery to remove cancer: $3,800There is still many more appts to follow in hopes Bruno’s tumor doesn’t come back so any additional money we can raise will go towards that. As well all know, Bruno is one of 3 of their furry babies and I want to personally thank you all from the bottom of my heart for donating anything you can to help The Hendricks’, they both have such big hearts to all their friends and family and would appreciate anything you can give (they also do not know I’m up to this so this will be a complete surprise to them).

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-save-spike,Help Save Spike!,"Hi everyone, We hate to do this, but our seven year old dog, Spike, is very ill.  On Christmas, I gave our dogs each a rawhide treat. Everything seemed fine.  On Tuesday following the holiday, he was even begging for food (as usual).When we let him out before bed, at around midnight, he lifted his leg but stood like a statue for at least five minutes until we made him come him.  He had a drink and went to bed. But then throughout the night, he began to vomit.We thought it was the rawhide treat, upsetting his stomach or maybe even blocking something inside his stomach.  We thought we would give it a day to see if he improved. Throughout Wednesday, he cried and vomitted whenever he drank water. By Thursday, he seemed to be improving, not crying or showing as many symptoms. Or so we thought. By Friday I was very concerned. We rushed him to the Emergency Vet.  Once, there, they gave him X-Rays and saw what they thought was a mass near his bladder. The doctor thought he may have cancer.  They told us they were keeping him for three days.  That visit was $800 and we were to pay an additional $1,500. About an hour later, they called and told us to get there immediately. Once there, they said we needed to get him to PVSEC on Camp Horne Road immediately (a thirty minute drive) and told us he may die on the drive there.Once there, they discovered he had a blockage of stones in his urethra and a tear in his bladder. They also felt his bladder was in very bad condition because of the blockage. On Saturday, they performed emergency surgery. It was one of the worst days of my life waiting for their call.  When they did call, they said his bladder was so bad that he had a 25% chance of surviving the surgery and a 25% chance of surviving after that. They told us it wouldn't be wrong to consider euthanasia.But we felt like we had to give him a fighting chance. So here we are. This is the third day after surgery. We've spent $7,000 or $8,000 so far. This isn't really about the money, but I guess that's why I'm here writing this message.  As you may know, we just bought a house and are planning a wedding.  I basically don't even care about these things anymore. Not til Spike is ok. It hurts in my brain, in my heart, in my stomach and chest and it's all I can think about.They said they'd have a better idea of how he's going to do 5-7 days after surgery. I wish I could go to sleep until then. But we need to do everything we can to keep him ok. We are visiting with him twice a day for a few hours. He's on lots of medicine and there's a ton of tubes coming out of him. He wags his tail when he sees us and all he wants to do is lean in to us and cuddle. It's awful leaving him. Anyway, if you could help at all, I can't tell you how much we'd appreciate it.  I know we have a lot of good things going for us, and have a lot more than some other people do. So, I know it's a lot to ask. Any little bit would mean the world to us. We don't have kids, despite wanting them. We just have our dogs and they mean the world to us. I work from home and spend almost every waking minute with them but our house is empty and lonely without him.  Dexi, on of our other dogs who has been there every minute of his life, can't stop shaking. Especially at bed time. We all need him and miss him and love him so much. Your help will help ensure that we get him back. And we need him so much.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/project-gol,Project GOL!,"""I would like to introduce you to ""Project GOL!”Roughly 1/3 of Sunnyside, Queens, the neighborhood where Grace Fellowship Church (GFC) and I minister, is Hispanic. Many of those are first generation immigrants who do not speak fluent English. In addition, almost 20% of GFC is Hispanic, and many of those also are not fluent in English. Although we translate our Sunday service each week into Spanish, we don't currently have proper spiritual and emotional care for many of these congregants.In addition, we have contact with over 150 families in Sunnyside, mostly Hispanic, as well as 45 junior and senior high aged students we call, CIT’s (Counselors-In-Training), who are former campers at Sunnyside City Camp—an all day summer day camp we conduct at our own expense. These young men and women continue to meet regularly throughout the year at our Grace Center and we see them as future leaders, as well as ministry leaders, and perhaps even church planters, in Queens, New York!Unfortunately, we just haven't had the resources to hire staff to invest in this key area of ministry. . . .until now.We have recently hired Kevin Arevalo to join the GFC staff as a pastoral intern. Kevin is a second-generation Hispanic (both his parents are from El Salvador) born and raised on Long Island. As a recent graduate of Reformed Theological Seminary, we’re excited to bring him on staff to focus on ministering to the Hispanic community as well as help develop our Community Groups ministry.GFC was recently blessed with a denominational grant for $100,000 to fill this position! It is a 2-to-1 matching grant that we will need to match over the next 3 years with $200,000. While this is a large amount, we have already received nearly half of that in pledges from those who believe in our work here in Sunnyside, Queens.There are more than 650,000 Hispanic people in Queens but a deficiency in grace-centered ministries intentionally reaching out to this huge demographic. We believe God is calling us to move into this need and we hope and intend this to be the first step in a long-term renewal and even leadership development among Hispanics in Queens. And, further, by God’s grace, even a new movement of Hispanic and bi-lingual church plants intentionally ministering and reaching their neighborhoods with the gospel of grace!We will be seeking financial investments from individuals, foundations, and churches from around the country but we are also reaching out to you individually, to see if you would be willing to invest now in this Project.Thank you for your help!Pastor Jon StorckHelp spread the word!",https://images.gofundme.com/uvQdK3aUgW8Y_J0SlnJy003Q_-4=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165250_1483464837.8969.jpg,[],0,"Created January 11, 2017",Stephanie Granade is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Kevin Arevalo.,Community & Neighbors,"$2,820 raised of $25,000 goal"

I rushed her to the 24hr animal hospital and they immediately put an IV in her and did blood work. Her liver enzymes and ammonia levels were super high. They said she has all the signs of liver shunting a common problem with schnauzer puppies. I had no clue! She remained in the hospital for several days having more seizures.

The Lord, in His faithfulness, has provided me with THE coolest opportunity for this summer.Joni and Friends is a ministry for families affected by a disablity started by Joni Eareckson Tada, the oldest living quadriplegic. Joni started this ministry as a way to reach people and to tell them the great news of Jesus Christ. She is well known for her disability but always points everyone to God and His goodness. Joni and Friends has a summer internship called Cause 4 Life where college aged students get to learn more about disabilities, those affected by them, and what Jesus can do through them. By the grace of Jesus, I was CHOSEN to participate in the coolest internship I've ever heard of, ever. Here's what the Cause 4 Life intership with Joni and Friends is all about: it is a 4 week internship based out of Agoura Hills CALIFORNIA (y'all... I'd literally be living in Cali for a MONTH). The first week, I'd be taking a class on biblical suffering and what the Bible has to say about disabilities (SO COOL. If you know me, you know how nerdy I am when it comes to learning... I am SO excited to take this class). The second week is doing things in the community of Agoura Hills for people with special needs like participating in Buddy Break which is a respite ministry and Friendship Club which is working with adults with special needs! The third week is getting to volunteer at a Joni and Friends Family Retreat!!!! This is the coolest part to me because I'd be paired with an entire family and get to serve every member of that family and learn more about how Jesus has impacted their lives through disability. LASTLY, I'D GET TO GO TO THE STINKIN' DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND SERVE IN A SPECIAL NEEDS ORPHANAGE!!! A DREAM!!!!!! Y'all. Wow. Incredible. Literally a dream. So here's where I need y'alls help. First: pray, pray, PRAY! If the Lord wants me there, it WILL happen. Please pray for what He already has in store for this summer for me as well as everyone I come in contact with. Pray that they see Him in me and that I serve people well not because of who I am but because of who HE is. Next: please consider donating ANY amount. $3,600. Wow. That number is huge. It's scary. It's intimidating as heck BUT I know that if the Lord wants me there, it will happen some way, some how. Lastly: pray some more. Pray, pray, pray and then pray again!If you know me, you know how much I love people with disabilities and how much JOY they provide in my life.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/our-syrian-family,Our adopted Syrian Family,"Hi! We are Roshni and Craddock. We were brought together by a desire to help refugee families in San Diego, California. We were blessed to be matched with our 'adopted family' from Syria who had to flee from Homs, Syria to Jordan after their neighborhood was bombed. The family of 5 applied for asylum to the US and, after a long vetting process of two years, they arrived here in July, 2016, and are living in a small apartment in El Cajon.Our relationship with the Syrian family: Our families  'adopted' them this year as part of a program initiated by Hearts4Refugees (more details of this organization are below). We have been visiting them off and on, as well as calling and texting to keep up communication. We hope to help them start their new lives in a new country and help them integrate into their new country.About the family: The family has three children, one 16 year old boy, a 13 year old boy, and a 10 year old girl. All the kids are doing well at school and trying their best to integrate, despite episodes of bullying by their peers. They enjoy music and dancing, especially hip hop. Both the parents are desperately looking for a stable job. They have learnt some English and have also enrolled in courses that they can continue to learn English from.  They are also looking for a reliable, inexpensive car for traveling to college and work. Unfortunately we may not post pictures of the family, for their own safety and privacy.About the organization we are affiliated with: This campaign is coordinated with Heart4Refugees.org, a private group formed by the Syrian Community Network, which seeks to help the Syrian refugees who have been resettled here and support them during their transition to their new lives in the US.How the funds will be spent:1. Payback travel loans2. Contribute to the rent deficit. The family's rental assistance is set to expire in three months.3. To buy a car 4. Utilities, internet access and other related living expenses until the parents can find steady work7. English learning resources8. Bus and trolley passesSpecific plan for withdrawal of funds: We will not be giving funds directly to the family as Hearts4Refugees recommends against it. Their guidelines strongly recommend that funds be used on the families behalf via the volunteer instead, so we will withdraw funds on the families behalf into our personal bank account and purchase items and services that they need while they make their transition to San Diego. If you would like to make a tax deductible donation, please contact us and we can work with you to make sure the funds go directly to the family's needs.We will keep you posted if you contribute on how your money was spent!Alternate donations: GoFundMe takes 5% of all donations. If you wish to circumvent this, you can send us a check!We believe we are very privileged when we have our basic necessities taken care of and we are of good health. Craddock is the daughter of Vietnamese refugees herself, and feels compelled to ""pay forward"" the kindness her family received upon arriving in this country.We would love to help this family as much as possible and we are now reaching out to you all to support us in doing so! We are grateful for any amount that you choose to give!",https://images.gofundme.com/15FmiGl9Qc_zwkEwoh02T_n4v1E=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165650_1483553885.4794.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Roshni and Craddock is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Craddock Stropes.,Community & Neighbors,"$1,776 raised of $5,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/shad-and-jordan-peel,Shad and Jordan Peel,"Shad and Jordan, my niece and nephew  were in a car accident on New Years Eve. They crashed into an embankment near Trickum and Ragsdale Road sometime between 7-7:30pm, and there were no other vehicles or persons involved. They were brought to Kennestone Hospital via ambulance for their injuries. Shad was assessed and diagnosed with a concussion, several minor fractures and many cuts, burns and bruises. He was discharged yesterday (Jan. 2) after a few nights in the hospital. He is in alot of pain and will wear a back brace indefinitely. We hope to have him back on his feet in a few weeks and pray for his quick recovery. Volleyball season starts soon and we are hoping he will be well enough to participate in his senior year season.Jordan is in a more severe condition and is in the ICU after several emergency surgeries. She first had a surgery for a broken back (metal rods and pins, etc.).  She had a large abrasion across her entire forehead and had surgery Sunday morning to have it stitched up. This will leave a scar, but there are many options for plastic surgery when she has healed. (She’s still as beautiful as ever, of course!!). The doctors discovered a leak in Jordan’s abdomen on Sunday afternoon. She was sent to emergency surgery Sunday evening and they removed a part of her small intestine. The surgery was successful but she is on heavy antibiotics to make sure her abdominal cavity doesn’t become septic.the doctors are closely monitoring her vitals. She has high heart rate and a slight fever, so they have her heavily medicated (induced coma) and on a breathing tube. Once Jordan is out of ICU, she will need extensive rehabilitation, either at a rehab facility or outpatient rehad.    Shad will also need rehab therapy.Because of the mounting medical bills,  the rehabilitation that will  follow, and that mom and dad will more than likely not being working full time in order to care for the kids, we are seeking to help them through the next few months so they can pay bills, etc. while they focus on their children's recovery.Thank you all so much for caring for this beautiful family.Please feel no obligation to contribute, but know that no amount is too small and every penny is helpful.  The last thing we want this family to think about during this time is money.  Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.  Shad and Jordan are fighters and we have faith they will pull through this trying time strong and healthy as ever.  We love and appreciate you all!",https://images.gofundme.com/BAD7-lWuctNgtM_oD7_v4egttgg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165656_1483467768.2727.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Lori Miraglia is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Danielle Riley.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$16,330 raised of $15,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-aisha-afford-immunotherapy,Help Aisha Afford Immunotherapy,"***UPDATE - I am heartbroken to announce that Aisha passed away from pneumonia on February 26th. I am currently considering suitable causes which could benefit from the proceeds of her campaign.*** In November 2015, my partner Aisha was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma. She has tried multiple types of chemotherapy, but unfortunately none of them have been able to get her into remission. A new type of immune therapy treatment could give her a chance of a cure. However, this treatment is not yet funded on the NHS, and the only way she can currently access these drugs is to pay for them herself. She needs this treatment as soon as possible.The funding goal of this project is £24,000, which will be enough to pay for the first two rounds of immunotherapy treatment - by which time we should have a fairly clear idea of whether or not it is working. This being said, the consultants have left us in no doubt that total cost may be upwards of £100,000 if multiple courses of treatment are needed. Still, anything we can do will be a start. ***UPDATE - We were recently told that Aisha will most likely require 25 cycles of immunotherapy, and we do indeed need to raise around £100,000 in order to do this. However, the good news is that each cycle will cost £4,000, not £12,000 as we had anticipated. Also, this would be administered fortnightly, and it is unlikely we'd have to raise the full £100,000 before Aisha could begin treatment - we could raise money alongside it. The funding goal therefore remains at £24,000, on the understanding that this total would get Aisha six cycles of treatment, and buy the campaign three additional months in which to raise the rest of the money.***I am organising a live music event on Sunday 12th March at Rebellion in Manchester, with all proceeds going towards the cost of her immunotherapy drugs. You can get tickets here: http://buckfest.bigcartel.com/productsBefore Aisha became ill, she was pursuing a promising career in research science, in the form of a Biology PhD in Essex. Much to the detriment of herself, the university and the scientific community, her illness forced her to abandon this endeavour until she could recover. Aisha is a wonderful, kind, caring young woman, whose adulthood is just beginning, and whose main goal in life has been to do all she can to help make our world a better place. She deserves the chance to beat this horrendous illness and get her life back.In the event Aisha does not need the money, then we are most happy to give it to a cancer charity who can use it to help other people in her situation.",https://images.gofundme.com/QylYBT_5_owvqSy-PQOHZVtGkNY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165744_1483466265.4212.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Francis Power is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","£18,030 raised of £17,979 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/darry-michelle-castor,Darry Castor Memorial Fund,"This picture was taken two years ago ... long before stroke-like symptoms sent our friend, Darry, to the ER on December 6, 2016. Initial testing revealed a much more grim diagnosis ... a brain tumor, Glioblastoma - Stage 4. This required immediate surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible without further impeding his motor skills. Within a 36-hour period, Darry suffered a massive seizure due to a build up of fluid on his brain. Immediate bed-side procedures were required. Darry slipped into a coma-like state, requiring full respiratory assistance and the insertion of a drain. To make these dire circumstances even worse, blood cultures were taken from the draining fluid, and it was found that meningitis had set in. After three weeks in ICU, a tracheostomy was performed and a feeding tube was placed in his abdomen. While we are very grateful that every day brings a small measure of progress, Darry's healing is still a long ways down the road. There have been so many offers of assistance, and all are greatly appreciated.  For the foreseeable future, Darry will have no income to support the home he and his wife, Michelle, own, nor will there be funds to pay the staggering medical costs of a long-term recuperation. Therefore, it is our hope that this vehicle gives you an opportunity to join us in donating to this family's immediate needs.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/HelpQueenTiki,Help us get our Tiki back to normal,"We are Victor and Vanessa and we started this page to ask all our friends, family and animal lovers for their help to fundraise money for our fur baby Tiki's surgery due to luxating patella condition on her right knee.  We are aiming to reach the goal by mid February when her surgery is due. Full story: We got married 2 months ago and we have a beautiful and lovely 5 year old Yorkie named Tiki. Everyone that knows us is aware of how much Tiki means to us, she is literally our fur child and part of our family. Tiki was born in September 19 2011 and we have been taking care of her since she arrived into our lives in August 2012. Yorkies are known for being delicate dogs, they are prone to suffer from skin problems, allergies but especially from their knees. There's this common issue they develop which is called luxating patella. This condition happens when the kneecap dislocates. Dogs may live with it normally, however when the condition starts affecting their daily life, causing pain, discomfort and developing other knee and bone issues, such as an ACL torn, damage in ligaments and arthritis, it becomes a risk that has to be taken care of.Unfortunately, when we got Tiki we got her a wellness plan not been fully aware that wasn't going to cover this type of urgencies that a health insurance plan would. Now Tiki NEEDS SURGERY, she has luxating patella in both knees, however her right knee is very damaged, it's dislocated and her knee cap does not have enough space to go back to its place and is permanetly in the inside. This is causing major risk of her ligaments to be damaged and a possibility of having her ACL torn. Tiki is a strong and brave little doggie girl, she still tries to live a normal life and walks and plays. However, she is very afraid of jumping because of the pain it causes to her knees, she has balance issues and tends to fall a lot because of it and walks inclining to a side. She cries sometimes when she is picked up and limps everyday, for that reason her doctor has recommended a surgery on her right knee. Been this not a life and death issue, we can not get any type of financial aid, not even from places like ASPCA (where she most likely will have her surgery done at). The only option we have is getting care credit, which wont cover the cost of the surgery completely, and these types of surgeries have to be paid in full before she goes in and we currently do not have the amount of money to cover it. That said, we are calling our friends and family, and animal lovers out there to help us to cover part of the expenses of Tiki's surgery! We are aiming for her to get surgery done by mid February and we hope we can financially afford to do it by then, any helps counts and will be GREATLY appreciated! Help us get our little QUEEN TIKI, as she is known in social media, back in shape and to normal, thank you in advanceVictor, Vanessa & Tiki","https://images.gofundme.com/Y4iBdcM6_iZhyp__tGr6bgpQoMQ=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165922_1483660845,1517.jpg","['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165922_fb_1483676341,8215_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17165922_fb_1483676159,2119_funddescription.jpg']",2,"Created January 5, 2017",Vanessa Gonzalez-Hernandez is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,905 raised of $2,000 goal"

He was born on January 16, 1982 in the Dominican Republic, Cotuí Province Sánchez Ramírez.Jancer dreams of modernizing the people who saw him born. Let his works speak for him, until he can take his modern and efficient constructions to every corner of the country.He began the realization of his desires studying architecture in the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, however his dynamism and enthusiasm prevented him from waiting to graduate to begin to exercise. And with the characteristic impetus of his personality, he worked before being received. Finally Jancer graduated as an Architect on April 14, 2008 and returns to his hometown; there he established himself permanently to begin the exercise of his profession, being placed to his charge housing and commercial works that marked only the principle of his aspirations.But his dreams have been unexpectedly stopped by an automobile accident produced the sad night of May 18, 2012. Product of this accident Jancer suffered severe traumas in the brain cranium, causing in turn a state of ""deep coma"" in which he remained for three long months, today 5 years and 4 months later, has advanced to a coma ""semi unconscious"", is awake and interacts with his environment, but does not speak, has a ""Spastic Tetraparesis"" that decreases the mobility of the four extremities, say arms and legs, due to injury to the cerebral cortex.However, there is great hope that by treating him with the proper physicians (neurologists, physiatrists) this tenacious warrior regain his health and we see him again being as kind, dreamy and capable as he has not stopped being still lying in a bed at the mercy of Mom and dad.Mom and Dad! His parents, who have not let themselves be defeated, have remained united, persevering and convinced that their firstborn will soon become what once was. (And all the honor and all glory will be of our Christ Jesus who after that mighty accident kept him alive to manifest himself in him as an instrument of faith).  According to the latest report of the neurologist who is taking his case in the Dominican Republic, there is a great possibility that Jancer De la Cruz regains his health, for this he must be subjected to an ""institutionalized therapy"" for three continuous and uninterrupted months.For this therapy, place arrangements have been made and will be carried out at the National Center for Neurological Rehabilitation Julio Díaz, in Havana, Cuba. The totality of this procedure reaches the twenty thousand dollars (US $ 20,000.00). However, after 5 years and 4 months of constant hospitalization and continuous and uninterrupted care, Jancer's parents have exhausted their financial resources and financial capacity.And with pockets full of faith, hearts full of love and our arms hopeful; we ask each and every one of you to be in solidarity with this noble cause and make donations in cash according to what your heart dictates.Thank you in advance for your cooperation.""Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due time we will reap but give up.""

Nació  el 16 de Enero del año 1982 en la República Dominicana, Cotuí, Provincia Sánchez Ramírez. Jancer sueña con modernizar el pueblo que lo vio nacer. Que sus obras hablen por él, hasta poder llevar sus modernas y eficaces construcciones a cada rincón del país. Inició la realización de sus anhelos  estudiando arquitectura en la Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, sin embargo su dinamismo y entusiasmo le impedían esperar a graduarse para comenzar a ejercer.  Y con el ímpetu característico de su personalidad, trabajó antes de recibirse. Finalmente Jancer se gradúa de Arquitecto el 14 de Abril del año 2008 y vuelve a su ciudad natal; allí  se establece de modo permanente  para  iniciar el ejercicio de su profesión, siendo puesta a su cargo obras habitacionales y comerciales que marcaban sólo el principio de sus aspiraciones.Pero sus sueños han sido detenidos de modo inesperado por un accidente automovilístico producido la triste noche del 18 de mayo del año 2012. Producto de este accidente Jancer sufrió traumas severos en el cráneo encefálico, provocando estos a su vez un estado de ""coma profundo"" en el que  permaneció por tres largos meses, al día de hoy  5 años y 4 meses después, ha avanzado a un coma ""semi inconsciente"", está despierto e interactúa con su medio, pero no habla, tiene una ""Tetraparesia Espástica""  que le disminuye la movilidad de las cuatro extremidades, dígase brazos y piernas, debido a la lesión de la corteza cerebral.Sin embargo, hay grandes esperanzas que tratándolo con los Médicos  adecuados (neurólogos, fisiatras) este guerrero tenaz recupere su salud y lo veamos otra vez siendo tan amable, soñador y capaz como no ha dejado de serlo aún postrado en  una cama a merced de mamá y papá. Papá y Mamá! Sus padres, que no se han dejado vencer, han permanecido unidos, perseverantes y convencidos de que su primogénito volverá a ser muy pronto el que un día fue. (Y toda la honra y toda la gloria serán de nuestro Cristo Jesús que después de aquel aparatoso accidente lo mantuvo con vida para manifestarse en él como instrumento de la fe). Según el último informe del neurólogo que lleva su caso en República Dominicana, hay grandes posibilidades de que Jancer De la cruz recupere su salud, para esto es necesario que sea sometido a una ""Terapia institucionalizada"" por tres meses continuos e ininterrumpidos.Para dicha terapia se han hecho los arreglos de lugar y sería llevado a cabo en el Centro Nacional de Rehabilitación Neurológicas Julio Díaz,  en la Habana, Cuba. La totalidad de este procedimiento alcanza los veinte mil dólares (US$20,000.00). No obstante luego de 5 años y 4 meses de hospitalizaciones constantes y atenciones continuas e ininterrumpidas, a los padres de Jancer se les han agotado los recursos económicos, y su capacidad financiera. Y con los bolsillos llenos de fe, los corazones llenos de amor y nuestros brazos esperanzados;  solicitamos a todos y cada uno de quienes puedan, que sean solidarios con esta noble causa  y hagan donaciones en efectivo conforme a lo que dicte su corazón.

It is available through their online store in both men’s and women’s sizes and retails for $100.   40% of each jersey sold will go to supporting Sarah’s RAAM effort. The horse, featured on the jersey, was inspired by the four-year-old thoroughbred race horse, Glory, that Sarah and her family have adopted and nursed back to health after suffering a broken pelvis in a starting-gate accident. The horse also symbolizes speed, strength and power — all things Sarah possesses and will need to win RAAM. http://velorosacycling.com/collections/special-edition-road-to-glory-jersey/products/special-edition-glory-jerseyTo read about some of Sarah’s previous races, visit:  https://sixcoopers.wordpress.com/   ORhttps://kylesbikes.com/blog/sarah-cooper-cyclist-profile https://twitter.com/iowacoop",https://images.gofundme.com/ZV-TBVZjyATbA_EClnwcc88T5wA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17166350_1483467542.7406.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17166350_1487868885.2306_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 3, 2017",Connie Mann is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Sarah Cooper.,Competitions & Pageants,"$6,040 raised of $8,000 goal"

This past summer, Sara suffered a near fatal stroke and it is only through a miracle from God she survived. This brain injury has left her confined to a wheelchair as she has experienced loss of mobility and full function of her body. She is a fighter though and has made progress and strides that are truly only explained by the Lord's divine intervention. Still, she has a ways to go with countless long term  physical, occupational and speech therapy visits ahead, as well as brain injury survivor counseling.  It's to no surprise that insurance only covers a portion of these visits that are needed for Sara. Each visit alone is $450/hour and transportation to and from each one is $175. As much as this has been emotionally and mentally devastating for Sara, her children, Stephanie and Ryan, and the rest of her family, it also brings unforeseen financial burdens. In order for Sara to make the absolute best recovery possible, one that would allow her to be able to walk again,  gaining some independence, these therapy sessions are dire and crucial. That's where we come in as a community and as their friends and family. Let's help ""Nana"" the best we can. Let's first and foremost continue to pray for her healing journey as it is going to be a long one. And if led, any donation amount you are able to contribute to Nana's recovery funds I know will be appreciated more than you know!

Jonathan has never gotten into any trouble, always gave his best in school and is has grown into a very responsible and hard-working young man. However, he now finds himself struggling from day-to-day for the necessities, simply because of the terrible timing of some unfortunate events. Jonathan’s struggles began after he was recently hit by a young girl who ran a red light and had no auto insurance. This accident left his car totaled and he did not have enough money saved up to purchase another. The loss of reliable transportation came at a terrible time for Jonathan and cost him multiple opportunities, including a great promotion within the company for which he works. Following this incident, Jonathan’s mother moved away; in effort to lighten his financial load, he arranged to lease a residence with two of his family members. Shortly after moving in, these family members left without notice, leaving only Jonathan’s name on the lease and additional financial strain during an already trying time for this young man.My family and I are helping this Jonathan because he is sinking, regardless of how hard he tries to keep his head above water.  We are doing everything we can to help him, but we can only do so much. For the first time in my life, I have seen with my own eyes how honest, hardworking people can try their best and still become homeless. The thought of someone so young, with such ambition and morals, losing absolutely everything he has worked for is heartbreaking. My goal for this New Year is to show Jonathan that people do care, and that sometimes a few caring hearts can turn someone’s life around.  Any advice or offerings would be greatly appreciated. Rest assured that any dontations made will contribute directly to helping this young man get back on his feet and pursue his career.

These migraines were affected by noise and combined with the sleep issues, in 2014 I started to not be able to hear out of my right ear. I believed that it was from the racing. After undergoing hip surgery and a hysterectomy in 2014, I decided that it was time for me to start doing things for Julie. Coincidentally, at the same time a job offer was made to me and it coincided with me leaving Dsr at the right time at the end of a season. My very last night working for Dsr while was in a car, for my first night in my brand-new townhouse. I suddenly became unable to speak. The words yes or no were all I could say.I started my new job, which didn't work out, but made me financially whole to where I can work from home and go back to school, which is something that I always wanted. Meanwhile, it was discovered that I had a serious sinus issue, so I had extra sets of sinuses removed from my head and entire inside of my nose rebuilt.... to hopefully fix my headaches. no go. 6 months later, we discovered two tumors in my brain. One was inoperable and then other one was completely missed by my neurologist. The one he missed would have ended my life fairly soon. The one that was inoperable according to my new Dr. whom I found after months of research, was the right man and team to remove and treat both. my medical expenses to get to this point are not under 6 figures. But my doctor limits me to very little amount of computer time daily, so I cannot take on a full time job for some rime. Maybe 7 months.Those who know me know that this is very hard for me to discuss and ask for. For anyone considering contributing, I wanted you to know the story so it is understood why a go fund me page has been started for me.

Most people who have had the same operation use colostomy bags which clip on to the stoma and securely, conveniently and safely collect output.  John together with 20 men and women in his community who have undergone the same life-saving operation have formed a friendship/support group in Lira. The men and women are forced to use carrier bags, tins and bits of cloths because they are unable to afford the cost of a colostomy bag. Infections are common as a result of using tin cans and carrier bags. Many people are unable to work or even leave their home because of the smell and embarrassment.In uganda, proper colostomy bags are 7,000 Ugandan Shillings (~$2). The average person earns less than $2 per day. Randstad has graciously donated a generous €250 to kickoff the cause.  While this is a great start, we are hoping to reach a goal of $2000 by the end of January to enable John and the community a chance at a  more normal life in 2017.  Can you help us reach our goal?

The following is what Mike has posted on FB. ""....She has had a couple falls over the last week and they weren't quite sure what it was and then I got a couple calls from my Aunt Bonnie Conard-Hamilton a couple days ago from the hospital in Salina, KS and they THINK that she has (please forgive me if I don't have this information exactly right) cancer in her leg, on her ovary, on her lung and in/on her brain and that's why she fell twice over the last week.Today they are going in and are gonna take a look at the spot on her lung and possibly remove it or some of it to find out if its cancerous or not. They want to start chemo this week, but they first need to get her body up to normal and her rate DOWN to normal because she is lacking normal health as far as her weight being below normal and her heart rate was extremely high so they spent 5 hours, I believe, trying to get it down to normal.I feel completely helpless because I can not be there. This is my slow season for work and Christmas and the boys birthdays has left me broke and this couldn't come at a worse of a time. We live in upstate New York so there is no way we will be able to make another trip to Kansas, but there IS something that I CAN do and that is to pray and put this in God's hands and that is the only reason why I am putting this out there.I believe in prayer because I KNOW first hand that prayers work because I have personally witnessed first hand the miracles take place. You may not know this because I don't always say anything when one of you guys ask for prayers for this and that, but I actually stop what I am doing, turn down the tv and pray for you guys all the time and now I am asking YOU to do the same for my Mother in hopes that it will change the outcome of the results that the doctors may or may not find today.PLEASE do not inbox, call or text my Mother right now! She needs to rest and she needs to stay calm right now until further notice. Either me or my Aunt Bonnie will keep you updated so PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT HER IN ANY WAY until we give the ok.Now, lets all turn off our tv and bow our heads and pray:""Father God, we first come to you in praise today as always. We thank you for the many blessing you have given us, will give us today and will give us in the days ahead. Lord, we come to you today in prayer for my Mother, Jeri Scheuerman, as she has become ill and we ask of you Lord, to be with her, to give her strength and healing. Father God, we beg of you to be with the doctors and the staff working on her and may you bless them as they look over her. And Lord, may you remove this illness that is there and heal her Lord for you ARE a healing Lord, a loving God and a compassionate God. YOU Lord, we trust in, we confide in, in all things on Earth and in Heaven and we put our trust in Your hands today and the days to come as we go forward in these difficult times. And Father God, we pray to you now heavenly Father, to give her courage and strength through the Holy Spirit. Reach into her heart and give her content and remove any fear or worry Lord. Be with her and bless her with a positive outcome and remove this illness in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.""I want to personally thank everyone that prays for my Mother. Thank you! And THANK YOU LORD for hearing our prayers and healing my Mother. THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

His acerbic tongue and insight into just about any subject, whether it was food, beer, politics, farming, or hunting, was always refreshing. Seric's broad wealth of knowledge and quick wit made him great company across the bar from you, sitting next to you at it,  or relaxing down with you at the Tick and Chigger ranch. His Heman gatherings and the floating/camping trips he hosted created a wonderful sense of community and togetherness, and there are countless people who can remember partaking in his generousity as he fed us and gave us places to play. His candor, gentle heart, and fabulous skill in the kitchen will be missed. While we can't give to the extent Seric gave to us, we can try and make things easier for his family.

As part of the Kidsave program, Meg and Dave committed to advocate on Sary's behalf and do whatever they could to find Sary an adoptive family in the United States. Meg and Dave introduced Sary to friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, and anyone else who may have been open to adopting Sary. During that process, Meg, Dave, Norah and Eve fell in love with Sary, and in September they started the process of adopting her! They're now far along in the process, and the next step is to fly to Colombia (likely in February or March) to bring Sary to her new home in Massachusetts! Thank you for your love and support during this very exciting time!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/let-parker-run-again,Let Parker Run Again!,"Hello Everyone!Meet Parker! She is a 4 year old Australian Shepherd-Boxer mix who LIVES to run. My name is Amanda and I adopted Parker from Puppy Love Rescue when she was 12 weeks old. Puppy Love Rescue finds dogs, especially pregnant ones, in kill shelters and matches them with foster families here in Wisconsin. The dogs are put up for adoption and the amazing families that foster them ask nothing in return but a little support for the food and medical bills for the dogs. Since her adoption she has been everything to me. Playmate, companion, soundboard and cuddler (sometimes). She means the world to me and keeps me from going crazy. If you know me at all then you know how much my dog means to me.Last year Parker was chasing one of her friends in the woods and I heard a yelp and she hobbled out to meet me. I carried her out of the park and went immediately to the vet she was going to. That vet put her on some pain medication and that seemed to be the end of it. In the summer she went back on it after a similar tumble and we decided to change vets since the limping wouldn't go away.Parker's new vet is amazing and wonderful and very knowledgeable. We were told that her sprinting has damaged her back left left. She has been diagnosed with a torn cranial cruciate ligament. Essentially that means that she can't go to the dog park, she isn't allowed to chase other dogs or bunnies and definitely not squirrels. This is devastating. We go to the park every day, we hike and swim and do everything together. Right now her spirits are okay, we play hide and seek and lots of mind games, but I know that if she doesn't get better and can't sprint like she used to she won't be happy. The good news is that a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy can fix her so she can get back to her old self. The bad news is that it is not cheap. Not at all. Worse, her surgery isn't covered by her pet insurance because it is a pre-existing condition from before she got the insurance. It's just us, Parker and me it's a little tough to scrape together all the funds needed so quickly. It's also really hard for us to ask for help, since if you know us we want to be the ones helping others. We would never normally ask for help, but right now we seem to need it, especially for limping Parker. Any support would be graciously appreciated. We are pretty sure the surgery + other medical check ups are about $6000 all together. We know there are a lot of other pups out there that need help too, and we will be using any extra funds to give to Puppy Love Rescue, the amazing animal rescue that saved Parker and her litter mates and her mom four years ago.Thank you so much for reading and any support!If you'd like to know more about Parker's situation or just want pictures/videos of the girl feel free to contact me!

It's a non-profit studio wanting to make recording cheaper for musicians. $750 will go toward hiring a sound engineer, $800 will go toward paying the other musicians, $450 will go towards booking studio space.The last year, I’ve realized that everyone’s dreams are valid. They are obtainable. They shouldn’t be dismissed simply because they may be hard to accomplish.

I'm willing to put in the time, effort, dedication, and work to make that happen.With your support, you’ll help me get that much closer to an important stepping stone, a full length album.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/MaryannaAndrusFund,Maryanna Andrus Scholarship Fund,"This site has been set up to accept donations in lieu of flowers for the creation of a scholarship fund in memory of Maryanna Andrus (later Maryanna Hartman and Maryanna Tacka), 1942-2016. We recently lost Maryanna to Alzheimer’s disease. She was greatly loved by the children, grandchildren, brothers and sisters, nieces, nephews and cousins she leaves behind, and indeed by many other people (friends, neighbors and co-workers) whose lives she touched. Maryanna’s family was not well off financially as she was growing up. However, the Andruses were one of the richest families on the northside of Elmira, NY when it came to the esteem in which they were held by friends and neighbors. In large measure this was due to the influence of the family matriarch, Betty Andrus, who was well known in her community for her kind nature and selfless generosity of spirit. From her mother Maryanna learned early to put the needs of others ahead of her own wishes. While still a child herself she became something of a second mother to her younger siblings, taking care of them and helping to raise them when her own parents needed to be away from the household working to make ends meet. She also began working as a telephone operator as a teenager to help support her family. In her large family, as in her mother’s family a generation earlier, the young men generally went off to college while the young women stayed home and worked, helping the family make ends meet. In her later years Maryanna fulfilled a lifelong dream to get a college education by completing an associate’s degree from Corning Community College when she was in her 50s, graduating Summa Cum Laude and earning full scholarship offers to complete her bachelor’s degree from numerous four-year colleges in New York and Pennsylvania. She did not continue her higher education because her condition of early onset Alzheimer’s disease posed increasing challenges to her in her studies. Her few years of college late in life were among her proudest moments, because she had the chance to pursue a dream that was not an option when she was a young woman right out of high school. The donations to this fund will be collected and used to form a charitable trust that will award partial college scholarships to young women like Maryanna who might otherwise lack the means to pursue college studies because of their own or their families’ financial hardship. The family of Maryanna sincerely thanks all those who choose to give to this fund, to be established in her memory, in lieu of flowers for her funeral.",https://images.gofundme.com/DBScGdbIUs6NBb-O2tPcZci3t5k=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17167736_1484941180.3825.jpg,[],0,"Created January 19, 2017",Steven Hartman is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Ronald Hartman.,Funerals & Memorials,"$1,865 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/getmygaitgoing,Final Bioness L300 Ft Drop System,"Hello!  I am Gabriel Tempest.  I am 14 years old.  I have mild cerebral palsy, which means I cannot walk without an assistive device.  I am raising money for a Bioness L300 Foot Drop System.  I currently use ankle-foot orthotics, which I have been wearing for the past 11 years.  While functional, they are quite bulky; I grow out of them every six months; and when no one is around to help me, I have to take them off (which is very hard for me to do) to crawl around the house.  One of the really great things about this foot drop system is that it would allow me to wear regular shoes.  Also, I would be able to put it on without assistance.  Finally, I believe and hope that this system will help me move towards acheiving my goal of walking without an assistive device.  The sooner I get these funds, the more quickly I can begin the process of teaching my brain how to get the muscles in my legs to fire the way they are supposed to.  Helping me to walk is one of the best gifts you could give me.  I am SO thankful for any help you are willing to offer!p.s.  At my recent Bioness evaluation, they determined I need both knee and thigh cuffs for both legs (2 yrs. ago they only recommended 1 knee cuff), so the initial cost of $5550 has almost quadrupled.  Since my insurace doesn't cover this medical device, the cash price for all 4 cuffs in $19,060.  The thought is my brain can learn to move my muscles (think neuroplasticity), so 3 years is a typical timeframe for this learning to occur.  There is an ongoing expense of $56/month to replace the 4 electrodes. So that's my latest news!!",https://images.gofundme.com/B4NaL8W-6S08sWioUTcBbOQpgNo=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17168788_1486573966.9217.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Connie Tempest is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$12,285 raised of $17,000 goal"

Gardner St. in Scottsburg. Most of the community of Scottsburg would know Fred as the Papa Johns Pizza deliveryman, Fred was also a black man in a predominately white community and he never met a stranger. If you knew Fred you were always greeted by a smile or a wave, he valued his jobs that he had and valued a good conversation.   Fred had recently suffered a stroke that limited his ability to drive and made life more trying, but he was still able to great others with a smile and/or happy wave. This go fund me account is being set up to pay for the funeral expenses of Fred Moss, Fred from what we understand left behind no family members that we know of that can currently afford the great expense of laying him to rest  and we now ask the citizens that knew Fred to help and donate to see that Fred is buried in the proper manner.   Of course this is a timely manner, please spread the word quickly, so that we can insure that Fred is comfortably placed in his final resting place. It is times like these that we have to look beyond our own problems and see that a donation here will go a long way in The Lords eyes.   Fred Moss will always be remembered for his continuous infectuous smile, personable outlook of life and the true fact that Fred Moss never met a stranger.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/isabelles-intensive-care-fund,Isabelle's Intensive Care Fund,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to read about our family.My name is Matthew and I, along with Regina, am the parent of two beautiful daughters: Scarlett and Isabelle.   Isabelle has had a difficult life in her short time on Earth thus far. Upon being born, she was placed in the NICU due to a seizure and the associated risks. After a stay with some of the most talented and genuinely decent doctors on the planet, she was sent home a week later with a clean bill of health. The following week, both Isabelle and Scarlett were diagnosed with RSV (Respitory Syncytial Virus.) [https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/] While Scarlett has struggled with the virus, she has thankfully been able to fight off the worst of it. Isabelle, however, has been hit hard. Two days after being diagnosed, we had to rush her to the hospital as she was vomitting what little she had eaten, became rapidly lethargic and stopped crying. Afterone long night in the hospital struggling to breathe, the virus started taking over; with her young, fragile immune system and the relentless sickness filling her bronchial tubes with mucus, her left lung collapsed. The doctors, thankfully, acted swiftly and started her on a ventilator and placed her in an induced coma so she wouldn't experience any pain or discomfort as her body tried to fight off the indiscriminate pathogen... This brings us to where we are today. Our family does not have great insurance, and with our seemingly indefinite stay at the hospital our expenses and bills are piling up. I am continuing to work as hard and as best as I can on what few hours of sleep I can find in between of taking care of us all.My hope is, in conjunction with my salary, to raise enough money to cover our family expenses and pay any medical bills that arise for the present and - God willing - future date when we finally get to bring our baby girl home and be a complete family again. I can't even begin to fully express what any amount would mean to us just to ease the stress and burden that times like these cause. I feel guilty even building this page because I *know* in my heart that there are children and families who are struggling and far worse off than we are. However, I have to try every last available option we have to make it out of this storm as safely as possible.

My story is not unfamiliar to my facebook family and friends. I battled a wound on my right foot for 5+ years that was treated as a diabetic ulcer with no success. Back in 04/2015, i switched to a new team of dr's and finally got a correct diagnosis. What i actually had is called verruca vulgaris wart that had grown into my foot and invaded cells and tissues. In 12/2015, U of M biopsied the wound and it came back as verruccous squamos cell carcinoma. I underwent a big toe and 1/3 of my foot amputation in 02/2016, followed by skin graft surgery 03/2016. In 06/2016, the foot was biopsied again only to find out the cancer came back. I underwent 2nd toe and another 1/4 of my foot amputation 08/2016, followed by skin graft surgery 09/2016. In 11/2016, tissue biopsy was performed again and the cancer has returned. It is a highly agressive type and very rare form of cancer i have. There is nothing left they can do on the foot due to critical bone structure removal. I am now facing amputation below the knee as a result. These funds are needed to assist with the out of pocket costs of the procedure, misc. copays, purchase of transportable handicap ramps that i'll need for my new living quarters, also towards the purchase of a hoveround or electric wheelchair. I have exhausted all efforts on my end and I am now reaching out for help. The surgery will be taking place no later than early March of 2017. I am just a decent, hardworking fellow citizen that needs help for my situation. The only thing i can offer in return is my promise to bring more awareness to this rare condition and fight through my struggles ahead.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/michelekidd,Road to Recovery,"Road to RecoveryHow our family fought backAugust 9th started out like any another day for Michele Kidd and her family.  Michele enjoyed her part time job at the new Marshalls facility in Warren, Michigan and began her shift that day as she would have any other day.  During the day she started to feel ill, and ended up fainting.  Her coworkers called 911 and Michele was transported to St. Johns Hospital Macomb.  Physicians knew her condition was critical as she was diagnosed with a dissected aortic aneurysm, she was immediately moved to Henry Ford where she was rushed into surgery. As she was being removed from the heart/lung machine, her body reacted with a Heart Attack and Michele endured a triple bypass and was now on a ventilator to breathe for her.  As physicians tried to wean her off the ventilator, Michele’s body suffered a third attack in the form of a stroke.  The clinical team respecting her families’ wishes to do everything they could to save her performed a tracheostomy, and inserted a feeding tube.  Michele’s kidneys had suffered acute injury and she now required dialysis to keep her alive. Once physicians had completed the intensive diagnostic procedures at Henry Ford and she was stable, Michele was transferred to Select Specialty Hospital which is a Long Term Acute Care Facility. This facility is designed for patients with serious medical problems that require intense, specialized treatment for extended periods of time. Under the careful watch of her husband, Bill and two adult daughters, Rochelle and Sam, Michele gained strength and began her journey back.  In early November, Michele was able to have her tracheostomy removed and her dialysis discontinued under the care of her Physician at Select Specialty, Dr. Seth Parker.  He spoke to the family on what her next step should be, and he recommended sub-acute care at Windemere Park Health and Rehab which is about a half an hour from the hospital.  By this time, Michele’s husband Bill and her daughters knew her clinical needs very well and wanted to make sure this recommended facility would pass their criteria to continue to care for Michele. Not only did they want to ensure her recovery would not be compromised they had their eye on a specific date, January 6, 2017.  This was a date that Michele was very much looking forward to, as her daughter Rochelle was to be married. It was at this time that both Sheri Lau, as the Admissions Director and Administrator, Tracey Ryckman became involved with Kidd family.  During their first meeting and subsequent tour of Windemere, not only were they assured by Mrs. Ryckman that Windemere could meet Michele’s clinical needs, she personally guaranteed that  “whatever” it took, Michele would be at her daughters wedding.  Michele admitted to Windemere mid-November and has worked very hard with Therapy services to regain her life, by increasing her function, mobility and strength. In December, Michele’s feeding tube was removed. By the first week of January, and one week before Bill and her daughters wedding, she can walk 40 feet with stand by assistance.  Through Michele’s perseverance and tireless dedication of her family, who visited her everyday without fail through her ordeal, she is prepared to walk down the aisle at her daughters wedding. Yep, she’s back.",https://images.gofundme.com/fZHO3EMj9Y48zz9-3qd76ZNOmG8=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17169084_1483572343.8266.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17169084_1483571240.2169_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 3, 2017",Samantha Kidd is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Michele Kidd.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,600 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36prdk0,Living With MS-Walk Aide Fund,"My name is Alicia, I recently turned 30 and I have a 5 year old son who is the light of my life. I was diagnosed in June of 2015 with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. I used to be a highly active young adult until my first attack hit me on July 4th 2015. I am not able to do a majority of things without assistance and playing outside with my son is difficult as I can not keep up with him My doctors can trace this back in my medical history for over 6+ years that the MS went undiagnosed and without treatment. My life has forever changed more than I could ever imagine over the past year and a half. I have slowly had difficulty walking, and treatments for the MS have had little to no effect. My left leg from my knee down to my foot is severely weakened due to nerve damage from the MS. I have fallen more times than I can count and currently have to use a cane to support myself. My left foot has foot drop which causes me to trip over it as it does not have reflexes to know when to pull up. This is damage to one of the major nerves in my leg, the peroneal nerve. This is causing my body to over exert energy to help make up for the lack of movement in my leg and foot. Now over the past 3 months I have been working with new doctors at a few different MS centers in western Washington. Most recently I was referred to a rehabilitation specialist who prescribed a walking brace. I made the first appointment available to have the brace made in hopes this can at least help with walking and mobility. The brace was made and off I go. Or so I thought....After a few go arounds with adjustments, the brace has helped a little bit however is highly uncomfortable and I am still having to use the cane. When I was in the office the doctor mentioned a new option to help with the walking, it is called the Walk Aide. The device is a small computer that sends a shock through the peroneal nerve that tells my foot to pull up. He asked if I would like to see if it can help me, as it tends to help around 75% of patients. I figured I might as well try it hoping for the best. As soon as the devise was hooked up I was still skeptical. I was asked to get up from the chair I was in and the doctor will follow me to set the system to know my walking patterns. I began walking, a little uneasy at first allowing myself to grab a rail when I felt weak and didn't want to fall. Then I was asked to walk back the other way to the chair again. I sat down and there was a huge smile on my face. I felt the taste of freedom and independence again. Next the doctor asked me to walk the hallway which was approximately 50ft, I felt a sense of confidence and went for it. The doctor could barely keep with me, and after about 20 minutes the system was dialed in. I began to tear up with happiness as I never thought I would be able to walk without assistance, let alone ever be able to play outside with my son. I thought to myself, great news technology was going to make my life easier so I can be safer and more active.

Jim was quiet, yet had such an impactful presence in the lives of those who knew him best. It is with heavy hearts that we come together to set up this memorial fund, as a way to support his loving wife, Stacie and their three sons, Joshua (17), Jared (14) and Zachary (11) in their time of inexplicable grief. Perhaps you knew Jim McCaffrey through the countless hours he spent volunteering, coaching and serving on the boards of our local Babe Ruth and Little League baseball organizations. Maybe you were a fellow Columbia High School fan, Jim’s own alma mater, and the place he and Stacie, chose to educate their children. You could always find him supporting his wife at a PTO event at Donald P. Sutherland where they devoted endless hours to the school community. Or, perhaps you shared Jim’s love for auto racing, himself racing sprint cars for many years. Maybe you knew Jim as a valued colleague in State government, where he was respected for his long and dedicated service. Regardless of your connection, all that had the pleasure to make Jim McCaffrey’s acquaintance knew him foremost as a devoted family man. A dedicated husband to Stacie, his high school sweetheart, and loving Dad with boundless energy for his sons, Joshua, Jared and Zachary. Whether fishing, camping, racing go-karts, or simply throwing a baseball, Jim always enjoyed life’s simple pleasures with his family. While known for his soft spoken nature, there was one thing Jim was never shy about and that was the love and pride he had for his wife and children.We hope that you will consider a memorial donation to the McCaffrey family to assist with final expenses, but also to ensure that they have continued health care, a place to call home and their children have the opportunity to continue on a path toward a promising future. As Jim’s family mourns his devastating loss, may together we honor the life they brought to his years, by offering our comfort and support.

He has been fighting some diabetes related health issues that have kept him off the road and off the stage. These issues snowballed until he ended up in the hospital in December, requiring surgery to try and save his foot and leg. At this point, he has no medical coverage to help with these expenses.  So far the tally includes multiple emergency room visits, six days of hospitalization, five days in an extended care nursing facility, IV antibiotics and specialized wound care twice daily as well as the materials necessary for the dressing changes, and several prescription medications in addition to numerous trips to appointments with doctors and specialists. Additional surgeries may be required as well, which will mean several more weeks of all the above expenses.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36ptx7c,Christina Stomps on Brain Cancer,"Growing up, Christina didn't have the normal, happy childhood. She watched drugs consume her mother's life. When she was nine, her parents got a divorce and she lived with her father and brother. In 2012, everything turned for the worst for her. Her father passed away suddenly from a heart attack. She was 17 years old and a senior in high school. She moved in with a friend's family and struggled with depression. Christina started pursuing her college education until September of 2014. Her mother passed away and she could not focus on her studies.   Christina was working at Olympia Sporting goods store. She started to have severe headaches, loss of coordination, and slurring of speech. It got to the point that she did not want to get out of bed because her head hurt so bad. September 2, 2016, we called her doctor and they told her to come in. After seeing her doctor, they sent her for a CT scan and then an MRI. They found a mass on the MRI scan and immediately sent her to the emergency room.   After being at the emergency room for several hours, they transported her to Georgetown Hospital. I rode in the ambulance with Christina and she was very scared. When we got to Georgetown, she was put in ICU. The surgeon came in the next day to talk to her about removing the tumor. September 4, 2016 the tumor was removed from her Cerebellum. Her recovery from the surgery was very long and painful. She was unable to move her head from side to side and the incision was about four inches up the back of her head.   We went back to see the surgeon a week later to find out the results. The diagnosis of the tumor was Medulloblastoma. This is a Pediatric type of brain cancer that can occur in children and young adults.   The doctors told us that radiation and chemotherapy treatment was needed to treat the cancer. While going through her treatments,  she lived at the Hope Lodge in Baltimore, Maryland. In Baltimore, she had six weeks of radiation, five days a week, and chemotherapy once a week. These treatments have left her with memory loss and other cognitive difficulties.   Currently she is living her 80 year old Grandmother and disabled aunt. On December 22, 2016, she started her next form of treatment which is four different types of chemotherapy. She will have to have these four different types of chemo every month for a year.   She is currently unable to work and has no income coming in. Money has been a constant stress factor for her. Every day she gets bills from the medical facilities, but has no way of paying them. I couldn't believe she was diagnosis with such a horrible disease when she had already been through hell all her life. We are trying to make this as stress free as we can for her financially, so any little bit would be a great help.",https://images.gofundme.com/L35AGAQDjKM2TNBxVECMdL70Zqw=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17169630_1483483520.209.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Regina McCallum is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Christina Pompell.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$7,615 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/mina-park-college-graduation-fund,Mina Park College Graduation Fund,"Mina Park is an undergraduate music major at Murray State University. She is entering her final semester before graduation, but financial burdens have made it imperative to call on the help of others to help her raise enough money to return to school and finish her coursework so that she may be able to pursue  what means most of all to her in life:a career in music.-- We all have a very personal story to tell, all filled with the most upright motivations to why we should be able to freely pursue our dreams. Because of this, the motivations of others can be seen as arbitrary campared to our own... For this reason, I have chosen to not directly tell Mina's story. I doubt I could give it full justice anyway. Instead, I will tell you of my experience with this extremely talented, intelligent, kind, and (beyond) driven person. It is my expectation that many of you who've met Mina have had similar experiences. --My first experiences with Mina were to be as expected: listening to her perform as a pianist. As a collegiate musician, it is easy for me to take for granted the many opportunitities I have to listen to talented musicians... but this was not the case when I heard her music.After taking the stage, her anxiety begins to project with trembling hands hovering over the keyboard, but the tense moment is short-lived once she begins to play. My ears and eyes were immediately drawn to the technical and musical maturity that was being demostrated - a skillful maturity rarely experienced with an undergraduate musician.Knowing Mina much more now than when I first met her 3 years ago, I can honestly say that she is one of the most self-driven and hard-working students I've had the pleasure of meeting.My relationship with her has given me a lot of insight into her efforts and routine. At all times she carries around with her a detailed schedule of her week that she keeps updated every day. On that schedule she manages to balance a vast cirriculum of classes, her on-campus job, accompanying rehearsals, numerous performances, and recitals & events she will attend. Outside of her many daily requirements, she can be found spending extensive hours in the practice room.Her night life is not one that conforms to that of a typical college students. Evenings that could be spent relaxing or enjoying time with friends are nearly all filled with homework, assignments, and preparation. As an international student from South Korea, Mina continuously dumbfounds me with her rigorous ability to tackle the obstacles that arise from English being a second language.While Mina  is surprisingly fluent in the English language from her time in the U.S., the many challenges that occur from studying in your second language are as expected. Short assignments can turn into long projects as you look up word definitions. Papers with great content are still graded more critically because of grammatical errors, Tests also become much more difficult when you have less understanding of context clues. Even taking notes in lectures can be frustrating when you hear a word or two you do not understand. Because of this barrier, Mina is not offered short-cuts like many students are. Neither does she offer herself any. Long nights of studying, reading, critical thinking and checking herself have resulted in her being a very successful student at Murray State.No doubt... Mina is an extremely hard-working, talented, and intelligent individual. Outside of music and academia, though, she also has the kind personality and life skills that will allow her to succeed.Throughout all of the work she puts in and struggles she faces, Mina generously offers a smile on her face and a welcoming personality that offers to help those around her. Despite how stressful as life is... she has the instinctful knowledge of how to get things done. These life skills range from her ability to communicate to simply responsible acts like preparing an entire week's meals during the weekends. These are not qualities of your average college student. Her optimism and joy makes believe in one certain thing: Mina loves music; she loves what she's doing! ... but she needs Your Help. This woman continues to put in the work, day-in and day-out. Unless she is able to raise the money to finish this last semester of classes and graduate in May of 2017, it may all be for nothing.Please join me in supporting this fine human being so that she may finish her studies, pursue her passions, and have a fulfilling life with a career in what she loves most:MUSICNo Donation Is Too SmallAnything you can do will help, including Sharing this with friends, family, and those you think can help.Sincerely... thank You SO much.- Zach Smith",https://images.gofundme.com/C0UgPc6yRghG_vI1VZGSzL5_gAA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17169742_1483475941.8715.png,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Zach Smith is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$2,205 raised of $6,000 goal"

He was hemorrhaging internally from a ruptured mass attached to his spleen. After an ultrasound, they found several large masses there and also some spots on his liver. He was taken quickly into surgery where his spleen was removed as well as 3 liters of blood loose in his abdomen. He did really well and has been home recovering with us since 12/28. This week we waited on the results of the biopsies to find out if the masses were malignant or benign. Unfortunately, yesterday we received the bad news that our Augs has cancer. We will meet with an oncologist next week after his sutures are removed to discuss treatment for the cancer and prolonging our sweet guy's life as long as possible. We have been told that with chemo he can live a little while longer with a good quality of life pain-free. Apparently chemo for dogs is much milder and without all of the side effects of chemo for humans. He will have more energy, feel better than he does now and be able to enjoy life for as long as we can keep him with us. We have started a go fund me account in hopes to raise some funds to help pay for his treatment. Unfortunately, we just don't have the kind of money necessary to pay for all of this. Augie is an important member of our family and has given us so much joy and love. We want to give that love back to him and help him to enjoy the time that he has. Augie deserves more time here with us, more time with all of his friends, a few more good beach runs and more time to lay in the sun. He's our best guy and we want the best for him.

The court members are asked to raise as much money as they can for the purpose of donating to the AHA. Last year, the court as a whole raised more than $40,000, and in the span of all King of Hearts fundraisers, Cedar Crest has donated about $400,000 to the American Heart Association. The leading collector from the court is named to King of Hearts at the KOH dance in early February.This year, it is my honor to say that I have been elected to the King of Hearts court. In order to break the records previously set, and to give even more to this great cause, I would be very thankful for any donations. I have set my personal goal as $5,000 due to the fact that if every member of the court aims for a similar goal, I know we can raise more money than any seniors before us. I am excited to take part in such a great event, and even more to help raise money for an amazing and important cause!If you would like a receipt for your donation let me know and one will be sent to you directly from the AHA.",https://images.gofundme.com/oX_oBzoRNM5veRitD4IGETaufwU=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17170186_1483476345.3884.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Jax Kelly is organizing this fundraiser.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$2,415 raised of $5,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/get-this-guy-a-baby,Get This Guy a Baby!,"Our names are Monica and Eileen.   We are starting this Go Fund Me for our incredible friend, Shawn Thorn.  We are reaching out to you and asking for support to help his lifelong dream of becoming a dad a reality.In the last year, Shawn has been dealt an emotional and financially devastating blow.  His journey towards fatherhood has evolved from being a dream , to  a reality, to a very costly journey that has led to nothing but complete heart ache. Shawn started the adoption process in 2013.  With a constant stream of obstacles, waitlists and red tape and no light at the end of the tunnel, Shawn decided to pursue surrogacy in 2015.  With the help of a very dear friend in Florida who offered to donate her eggs, and a surrogate here in the Lower Mainland, the idea of having a child who shared his very own DNA was a conceivable reality. In the spring of 2016, Shawn’s first IVF treatment had been successful. He was delighted and giddy with anticipation that his dream was finally coming true - he was to be a father.  Three weeks in to the pregnancy,  and three years after applying to adopt, as luck would have it, adoption services contacted him about a little 3 year old girl who needed a family; she sounded so ideal. Unfortunately, Shawn had to decline due to the seemingly successful surrogacy.  As you can imagine, this was a very emotionally conflicting moment for Shawn.   Three weeks later, Shawn was given the devastating news that the pregnancy had miscarried. The grief and pain of loss was devastating to him and he was only consoled by the fact that he could try again. Sadly, by the end of 2016, Shawn had a total of 3 miscarriages and 1 failed embryo transfer attempt; a total of 4 unsuccessful IVF treatments with the surrogacy totalling a value of nearly $75,000.  He literally put his life savings into making this dream a reality, and now, to him the dream has been lost and the cost of starting the process again is more than he can afford. Here is an excerpt from a letter he wrote to close friends: ""My heart is sad and there's a certain vacancy that is strong an prominent since last week, the day I found out that she had the miscarraige. I've cried endless times throuought each day since then.  It's uncontrollable at times. My eyes tear when I'm not even thinking about loss...It's unbearable at times. It's like that feeling you get in your stomach when your heart is broken; it's like all the butterflies have just died."" Shawn has yearned for fatherhood at a deep soul-aching level. He has built his life and career around being with,  supporting, teaching, adoring and loving children.  He helped raise all the children in his family and most recently has been a father-figure to his cousin's daughter who adores him.  He is also a doting Godfather to one of his best friend's 18 month old twin boys. Those of us around him who love and adore Shawn are not willing to see his dream die. So, we have set up this page to help support Shawn in raising the money to start the surrogacy process again.  Any contribution helps. We want to see this guy get his baby. More About Shawn Some of Shawn's friends and family have reached out to him since he decided to end his journey with surrogacy. To get a sense of his character, here is what they have said:  ""I am so thankful that I can be a part of your journey. I am beyond honoured. You deserve kids and it needs to happen for you. I know I'm just your surrogate, but I've fallen in love with you and your family, and you deserve this and I would do anything in my power to help you."" -Cara (Shawn's surrogate) ""I hope that you recognize how amazing you are and how much joy and happiness you bring to others."" -Jackie ""Life is such a mystery . . . so much of outside our control . . . yet blessing abound at the same time. And you my friend are a blessing to the world. As always, I know you are keeping one eye on the future, setting beautiful and positive intentions. My arms are around you, you are not alone."" - Gary ""Yet through it all, you still have a postive outlook on the future. You have truly been though so much. . . you must be extremely strong to endure such hope and loss all at the same time. I'm sending my loving wishes at this time and am thinking of you. Please know that all you do to help others makes you the greatest ""Dad"" to all. There is a reason for everything so never give up and your dream will come true.

Growing up in the small, salty hamlet of Montauk I have learned a lot, worked very hard and have been blessed to have to been a member of this special community. And now it is time for me to step out and follow my dream. I have been fascinated by food and how it works my whole life. I was born into the food industry and nurtured by two people who surrounded me with good for you foods. From there I immersed myself within all aspects of food and service. But most intriguing to me was always the creation of food. The blending of flavor, combined with the nutritional benefits of each ingredient. And the joy that food brings, right from the moment of creation to the moment of consumption.I have recently been accepted into The Natural Gourmet Institute's Chef Training Program. There I will learn the much needed skills and acquire an immense amount of education as to how food works for the body.I am taking a huge leap, but it is time. And it is also time for me to be a litle humble and ask for help. In order for me to do all of this I will need to relocate to Manhattan. And I would love to be able to dedicate all of my time to school and my studies. So I am setting up this Go Fund Me, to literally do just that. My schooling will begin full time March 13 of 2017, which is right around the corner.If you can help me, I believe in my heart from there I will be able to help so many. I will be able to live my life helping people achieve health. Assist them in their journey towards good health. I want to give to others what I have. To help another to feel good, gives me so much pure joy. And if I could do that for the rest of my life, to begin this path and journey of culinary knowledge and never stop learning, that would be a dream come true.Thank You so much, all that are in my life and all that have encouraged me to get here.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/beat-cancers-booty,#AllinwithTodd,"Hello all, my name is Maddison Harkey. Recently, a brother of a dear friend of ours was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, which is cancer in the bile ducts of the liver. It is located in a majority of the cells in his body as well. Usually, this cancer is found amongst third world areas. Dr. Todd Crowe is in his 40's and has a wife and children in college . I really do not know him, in fact, I have never even gotten the chance to speak to him. You may be wondering why, since I do not know him, would I be raising money for him. Well, to me, if you have the ability to help someone in any way possible, you should take the initiative and go for it. Also, Todd's brother, our friend, and his family are near and dear to our hearts and I want to do anything possible to help. I was actually drying my hair today and I was thinking about his situation and how I could help. I accidentally clicked on an email when I set my phone on the counter and when I went to pick it back up, it happened to have been an email from Go Fund Me. I get their emails often because I have used this website before to raise money for a sweet friend of ours. I really have no idea how to explain this incident except for the act of God. I thoroughly believe that He is holding onto this man's hand and is guiding him through this bump in the road. The reason I am here is this: God gave me the nudge that I needed to help. I am asking for anyone that is capable to give, to give as much as you can or feel is necessary. Chemotherapy/treatment is expensive and it is tough. It is hard to put a specific number on the price, as well. I know that anything will help though, which is why I am here. Five thousand dollars will not cover all of the costs but it can most definitely help. There are numbers of Bible verses that explain the goodness in giving but I gathered a few that touch me personally....-2 Corinthians 8:7- But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you[a]—see that you also excel in this grace of giving.-1 Peter 4:10- Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.-Acts 20:35- In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ -Deuteronomy 16:17- Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you.We are told that we are not here to bask in our own wealth and flaunt the money we have. We are here to be kind and help one another. To a degree, we are all family and family is called to help each other. Now friends, I did not mean for any of those verses to make you feel bad or guilty. If you cannot give, please do not feel obligated to! We do not have to meet that goal. I really had no idea where to set it but I promise ANYTHING and EVERYTHING will help. If you are unable to give(and also if you are able), I ask that you pray for a miracle and strength for this man. I also ask that you pray for strength for his family and friends so they are able to support him and be with him through it all. We are #AllinwithToddThank you all for everything and God Bless, Maddison Harkey",https://images.gofundme.com/4_Udl2SHtrmbUQzB9dLTlz6NM1Q=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17170838_1483477208.3092.jpeg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Maddison Ryan Harkey is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,630 raised of $1,000 goal"

I'm hoping to raise a little money to help me over a financial hump. I retired Honorably from the US Coast Guard back on Sept 1, 2015 after 24+ years.  Two weeks lateron the 15th I started X-ray Technician school in Vista, Ca. During my program I made the Academic Honor Roll seven months in a row (quite possibly more but the school has been unresponsive in getting me the rest of my certificates; but that's another story). My monthly income decreased by 50% after retirement, however while attending school my Post 9-11 G.I. Bill helped me cover housing expenses. Throughout my career, I was hampered, hindered and burdoned with an unsupportive marriage. Now there is a court order for spousal support; that is essentially crippling me. Those of you that have known me in the past 25 years undoubtedly can relate to or recollect one of my many stories of a dreadful home life. Anyhow; I'm asking you all for a one time gift.  I have always told friends that try their luck at the lottery; ""If you win - will you loan me 5 bucks"".  So, with good luck wishes at winning sent your way;  ""will you loan me 5 bucks?""

Two of the biggest recent restaurant successes in this city have been BBQ and fried chicken. This is a meat and potatoes town. Midwest eaters love fried, heavy, brown foods laden with fat and cholesterol.  Even some of my most open-minded friends are resistant to healthier eating—largely because there are very few options that celebrate or teach the vegetarian diet. With general health declining and obesity rates going up, it is important to bring this lifestyle to the mainstream.As technology exposes us to different cultures and food habits there is an opportunity here. People want to eat healthier but are not sure how. If we provide a consistent, flavorful product that is balanced and portioned correctly we will show people that eating healthy can be fun and more importantly, easy.

He not only applies his prosthetic makeups, but creates them in his work shop. His fluency in all areas of makeup, from glamour to fantastic and sometimes horrific cosmetic illusions, is well known in Hollywood and respected by his peers and admired by movie fans.  Not so well known is his expertise as a sculptor and moldmaker, skills that have been the bedrock of his career. Perhaps it was inevitable that he would one day follow in the path of his illustrious Great, Great, Grandfather Daniel Chester French (April 20, 1850 – October 7, 1931), one of the most prolific and acclaimed American sculptors of all time and best known for his design of the monumental work, the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.  The Sphinx sculpture for Military Intelligence Corps is Ed French’s first public monument, truly a labor of love and a tribute to the men and women of Delta Company, 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion.  French generously has donated his time to design and sculpt the Sphinx as well as supervise its installation at Fort Bragg.  Disclaimer:  This project is the work of private citizens and is not affiliated with the United States Army.  Any use of US Army images does not imply the endorsement of the US Army for Mr. French or his work to honor the men and women of the US Army..",https://images.gofundme.com/-WlyqKRdu_qJyBShM4k_WD4nhlk=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zh2eFMc7ybY/0.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17171818_1483480310.777_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17171818_1483480284.0934_funddescription.jpg']",2,"Created January 3, 2017",Diane French is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$6,799 raised of $25,000 goal"

Dusty is not a military vet, but he stands with his flags and honors our military, police, fire & rescue, and America. Dusty unfortunately lost his home a while back, and has run into some troubling times, which has made him homeless and sleeping in a shed. He has been unable to stay in a shelter, because they won't allow his dog Bear in to stay. He's also been going through some issues with disability turning him down several times, but that's about to change soon. Everyone knows that Dusty has never asked for a penny or any favors. He only wants others to ""pay it forward"", and respect our country and servicemen. To ""pay it forward"", this GoFundMe page has been set up to help Dusty and Bear get back on their feet so that they are able to travel and spread their awesome works of ""Miles for Smiles""! Our goal is to raise enough to purchase a small rv, the title, registration, and insurance costs to get it going, gas, and supplies to help stock up in the rv. Let's gather together and give back to Dusty and Bear, so that they have a reason to smile while starting a fresh new life in 2017. Update: Due to an illness that Dusty was diagnosed with, he is unable to personally operate the rv himself, but his son will be the one responsible and transporting him to achieve his ""Miles for Smiles""!

Ray truly was part of the family.   He was the first one to open the doors in the morning and here until every other team player was in at night.  Ray was always there, for everyone, no matter the time.  When we locked up shop Friday December 16, 2016 he gave me hug,  saying "" I love ya, dear"" as he always did.  Never did it cross my mind when I told him I loved him and to have a great weekend, that it would be the last time I got to receive one of his warm embraces.  The phone call came Saturday afternoon from his daughter, Frances.  In hysterics she exclaimed, ""it's my dad, they can't get him to respond.  Please tell me he will be okay.  I don't know what to do, I can't lose my dad.""   I quickly informed my father of the news.  We dropped everything to go to the hospital.  It was there we found out Ray had collapsed on that snowy, cold Saturday afternoon.  He had gone out to put ice melt on the walk when he fell face first into the snow.   A lady driving down the street whitnessed the incident and called 911.  Rays son-in-law, across the street, performed CPR on him until the paramedics arrived.  On the way to the hospital they revived him three seperate times.   On Monday, December 19, after three long days in the hospital ICU waiting room his family and loved ones received word that Ray had little to no brain activity.  The cause is still uncertain; a severe heart attack, or perhaps brain aneurysm.  This tradgic event was the last thing anyone in his family expected or needed.  Ray was the backbone of his family.  He took care of his wife, three girls, four grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. Not to mention ANYONE who needed ANYTHING.  He was constantly cooking for our employees, friends and family.  He was there for me at the drop of a hat, and I know that is how he treated everyone in his life.  Two of Rays daughters are fighting lupus, constantly in and out of hospital care.  One, still on the kidney transplany list.  The money raised here will be for whatever areas they need assistance with: medical bills, food, daily bills. etc.    Ray exemplified what it meant to have a heart of gold.  He, and his family have touched so many lives, mine is just one.  Although he is gone he will never be forgotten.  Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you, and God Bless.",https://images.gofundme.com/beJ7ChSNlvnHHrb2Z6VtWj21rJ0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17172482_1483482971.9229.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Kali Grubaugh is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Marie Lucas.,Funerals & Memorials,"$1,875 raised of $20,000 goal"

In December of 2015 she allowed her husband to travel to Australia with the children.  There had been a death of family member and she knew they needed him just as much as he needed to be with his family, as he had been living in Canada for some time.Since my daughter had previously overstayed in Australia it was agreed she would travel there in May 2016 (when she would be allowed) or if things were settled with his family that he and kids would return to Canada.Unfortunately, by March their marriage (which was already rocky) broke down completely. The negotiations regarding the custody of the children started and went on unsuccessfully for months.  My daughter saved enough money and sought legal counsel. Her case was heard in court in November 2016 and she was granted interim sole custody.  Sadly, her ex is either unable or unwilling to comply with the court order to return the children to Canada.  This means we must travel to Australia to bring them back.  My daughter has depleted all her funds and works in the service industry, so her income is low.  I really wish I could help her, however we are not currently in a financial position to do so.  As you can imagine the logistics of this effort are complicated and come at a high cost. It involves flying two adults to Australia and back with 4 children. Additionally, they are located 8 hours from a major city, thus we will need to rent a large vehicle for transportation. Hopefully we can get all of this done without needing to stay overnight in a hotel, but it’s entirely possible that may happen.Online search of flights show the return trips for 2 adults at just over $2500.00 per person and one way trips for children are close to $2000.00 per child. Flights alone will easily be 13-15,000.00. Once we add in the rental vehicle and other costs, like the potential overnight stay; I believe it could cost as much as $20,000.00.Those of you who know me, know I have a bookkeeping background and currently work as a Financial Controller. I will be the one responsible for any funds raised. All funds will be under my control, tracked and used for the costs associated with returning my grandchildren to Canada.I know times are tough financially for everyone, any amount you can give will be greatly appreciated.If you have any comments or questions feel free to reach me through this page.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gardnersjourney2southamerica,Gardner's journey to South America,"MY STORY:My name is Gardner Fenton Goetze,  I am an actively performing musician, writer and visual artist from the San Francisco Bay Area. I am headed on an inspiration quest/music writing/performance trip to Argentina on January 16th 2016 until the end of February. I have been planning it for months. In my heart, for years. However, I was recently hit with a few major blows that took away all of my funds for this trip. These multiple unforseen family traumas come on top of an already existing dead stop of inspiration, under which I have created nothing new for entirely too long. With your help I will travel to South America for my first time, shake off all of the dust, document the experience through the creation original music, collaborate live with one very talented musical family, and return home to record a WICKED new album with my crew.THE MISSION:Where I am headed for most of the trip is a community called San Marcos Sierras way down in Argentina. My great old friends who live here now have a very cool classic band called Mucho Axe (Salsa/Reggae/Cumbia), but its also the whole city, community, and surrounding landscape/soundscape that I'll be headed for. These are great friends that I haven't seen in 10 years since they moved back to Argentina after living in the Bay Area for some years. They inspire the best in me, thats for sure. My mission is to travel down here, refresh the soul, restore the creative production drive and put a killer new product on the shelf and stage. I will translate the heavy influences of cumbia, salsa, tango, reggae, the music of the southern stars, the rain, the first people, the ladies, the goofballs, the dance, the drums and other regional rhythms into my new sound. This will come with new ideas for live performance and set design (which will involve bands and teams) and will also provide new perspective on political history, human responsibility for conservation, citizenship, community, and country.  Of course we will play the Blues as well :).  I will create a demo when I'm down there and then professionally record the new music back here in California. Behind me lies the most challenging year of my entire life, in front of me hopefully lies the most inspired and creative one.  FUTURE SUCCESS: While writing this new body of music I will surely be learning new forms of everything, including guitar playing, composition, rhythm, and general life drive. I plan to return and record this in 2017 resulting in a whole new era of performance, touring, and merchandise sales.  A full circle return indeed. So, my friends and family...I present an invitation for your financial help on any level you are inclined to reach! Your donations will allow me to bring this to life. Some rewards are offered after this album is done. Check em out. This is the first time I have ever publically run a crowd-funding campaign, so I am nervous! I leave for this journey on January 16, 2016. Funds needed ASAP. I realize my departure is very nearby, but this idea just came to me after very unexpected expenses set my budget back to basically nothing. My people, the show must go on! YOUR DONATIONS:Your donations will help in covering any of the following before and during this 1.5 month trip: -Transportation expenses in Argentina (bus travel, charter airfare) - Some hotel accommodations and food when necessary-Travelers insurance (Health care abroad, lost/stolen compensation, and a myriad of other coverages)-Mobile Recording equipmen, travel guitar repair and case,-Art and musical instrument supplies. - Unknown expenses that may arise, which surely will- Any Additional funds above the goal will be fully assimilated into this creative project, as the initial $3,000 goal set here is pretty much all for travel. But there is ohh so many other elements to a project like this that these funds can help with!!ITINERARY:And here is a small list of known and possible stops on the trip itinerary:-Buenos Aires and surrounding sights, including a unique food tour with a chef who will be accompanying me on this journey.-San Marcos to drink mattes and play multiple shows with Mucho Axe (Salsa, Reggae, Bachata Band) and whoever else I discover! - A possible jump to Iguazu Falls-Along the way I will find myself doing any number of amazing things not yet determined because the trip is open ended when I get there. Thats the point. To follow something brand newCONCLUSION:What I know how to do best is nourish creative nature. Every day try I to make this place more colrful, humorous, and funky. Recently I have been entirely unable to realize this, the skill set is gone right now. It has been tennis-racqueted away somewhere. I need to fly far away to this land and find it, simple as that. Do to all of the major blows from the recent events, rust and dust have built up a creative wall so high I can no longer see over it. This journey will be an airplane flight and a summer season right over that wall, and we can get going again! Travelling is one of the best ways to heal, release and grow up from tradjedies and trials of our life, and move on. Documenting it all into a musical story is my goal.This inspiration quest/writing/performing trip to Argentina with my great friends will be the beginning of a healthy new era in my life and creative career, which I share with everyone by nature. You will all get to dig it in the form of a RIPPING new album, a new era of live performances, and a re-awakened new-old friend :).

https://www.gofundme.com/f/team-dandurant-cancer-fight,Team Dandurant Cancer Fight,"My brother-in-law, Peter Dandurant, age 43, was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer. It has spread to his lymph nodes. After two months of abdominal pain and multiple doctors visits a blood clot was discovered in his left arm that goes from his elbow to his neck. This has caused a series of tests and scans, including a biopsy which revealed the presence of cancer. He is currently on chemotherapy treatment, 4 shots per day of blood thinners and full time on oxygen. He requires 24 hour care and transportation to all of his doctor appointments.In December, he was hospitalized in the ICU and placed into a medically induced coma for collateral issues related to the cancer. He spent 9 days in the hospital, including Christmas Eve and Christmas. Peter was upset he missed spending his favorite holiday with his family at home, but they were right by his side at the hospital.Upon his release, Peter was able to celebrate the holidays at home with family and friends on New Year's Eve. However, later that night after everyone went home Peter was rushed back to the hospital and admitted back to the ICU. He is still there.Peter does not have short-term disability through his employer. His wife has taken medical leave from work to be by his side and care for him. Up until his illness, Peter worked full-time as a machinist for the past 26 years. He is unable to return to work.With Peter not working and with a Mortgage, Student Loans, Car Payment and now Medical Bills, there is a significant financial burden.Peter is the last person to ask for help, though he is often the first to offer it. He is a loving husband who has been with his wife for 21 years. He is a devoted son, a loyal friend, a good brother, a hard worker, provider and a doting uncle to his many nieces and nephews.Peter and his wife were foster parents to four teenagers throughout the years, opening their home and hearts to their ""kids"" who they still maintain a relationship with.Peter always puts others first, but now needs to focus on beating this disease. We lost Peter's dad in May 2015 due to complications of Lung Cancer.I am asking everyone reading this to please help Peter focus on fighting the cancer and relieving some of the financial burden, by donating today.Thanks, Tammy Dandurant (sister-in-law)",https://images.gofundme.com/uxKTcXam6pi1d0hpit_8vUCtV2k=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17173548_1483483223.9562.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Tammy Dandurant is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Rena Dandurant.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,275 raised of $50,000 goal"

My name is Andrew Endres and I lead and perform in the music projects AEC and Mordecai.On Christmas Day, while on tour, our music gear was stolen in Salt Lake City along with all of our instruments, merchandise, and personal belongings. Our losses are estimated somewhere between $10,000-12,000 (Which is honestly a conservative estimate.)We are now unable to tour or perform because of the lack of instruments and funds to buy back similar equipment. This is the means for how we support ourselves, afford to eat, and how we are able to give back to the community. We were also planning on releasing 3 albums by the end of the year and touring to support each of the albums. Now, with the instruments/gear stolen we may not be able to afford to bring this music to life or to show it to the world. This is a call for help to our friends, family and fans. I am personally devastated by the recent events. Most of the gear that was stolen was mine personally. This Go Fund Me project was made to help get us back on our feet, so we can get back to work as soon as possible and continue to bring our community more music.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/savethegreensborofringe,Save the Greensboro Fringe Festival,"The mission of the Greensboro Fringe Festival is to support new and innovative performing artists by showcasing their creative works in a professional environment.  Service to the Greensboro Community- The Festival is designed to promote downtown Greensboro as an exciting center of entertainment and culture. We have these amazing new recreational areas and facilities such as the new Lebauer Park that's right outside our window and the Tanger Performing Arts Center that's in the construction phase. These were million dollar projects. The city has all this activity surrounding the vitality and livelihood of Greensboro's citizens and we want to maintain that momentum by producing great art that everyone can support. Celebrating 15 years-  Since 2001, we've relied on the generosity of our venue owning friends and small business partners who would buy ad space in our programs or offer to donate materials and that kept our costs low in the early days. Urgent Need- This year we are in a unique position in that we are entering this year's festival in a financial deficit. We are utilizing newer spaces and making different choices to really give the community a bigger season to celebrate our 15th year. Unfortunately, this may be our last season. We are in greater need of financial support than anticipated and we would like to involve the community in our efforts to stick around for many more seasons to come. We have plans to crowdfund, which isn't much different from our usual petition for donations at the door, but the funds earned through this campaign will go directly to lowering our abnormally high overhead fees. We'll be announcing that in the coming week and sharing more details on where and when to give through the Fringe Festival's website, facebook and twitter pages. The campaign goal is $3,500 .

https://www.gofundme.com/f/SAmission2,South Africa Missions Trip 2,"Hi everyone, As many of you may, or may not know, I have been a volunteer supervisor with the The Father’s Heart Ministries, I  have gone through their ministry training, and serve weekly in their programs. The Father’s Heart  is sending a team of volunteers to South Africa in February.  We are planning a 10 day trip to serve in the various ministries there. We have been invited by First City Baptist Church in East London, South Africa to join them in serving the people of their region.  Our outreaches will be to those discarded by society and beaten down by poverty, abuse, and hunger. Previous teams have ministered to the homeless, to sex workers, rape victims, orphans, and those suffering with AIDS. We will have the opportunity to go into the most impoverished and needy communities to offer hope, encouragement and whatever resources we can. We have also been invited to spend time at Hope School, a school established for children infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. Many of these children are orphans, and have already experienced the trauma of loss, violence and rape. The school is a place of safety, a place where they are fed, and offered a way to break the cycle of poverty and death they live in.  In truth, much of what we will be doing in South Africa,  we already do in NYC at The Father’s Heart. However, here at home we are comfortable and experienced, and good at what we do.  This trip provides an opportunity for us to serve outside our comfort zones and beyond our current horizons. We believe God loves all people, and God heals. These beliefs will be tested in the face of children and a community ravaged by AIDS, hunger and broken by suffering. The Father’s heart does not reside in NYC, or in any one place, but within us, His children. Please consider helping me, bring His heart to South Africa.My fundraising goal is $2,000 that will cover basic expenses of the trip such as airfare, food and lodging.  Anything we raise above that will help enable our team to leave a meaningful gift with the ministries in East London.Thank you so much for your consideration.",https://images.gofundme.com/_QOVgeb-JZgz1Lm3Z_LHahsjvXM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17173936_1497315175.7741.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",David Cordova is organizing this fundraiser.,"Missions, Faith & Church","$1,610 raised of $2,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/AApilotscare,AA Pilots Doing The Right Thing,"Doing the Right ThingThe Allied Pilots Association has set up a Go Fund Me account to help offset the medical expenses of Ulysses Griffin, a bus driver at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Mr. Griffin was injured in a bizarre accident on Dec. 30 and is in the intensive care unit at Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Grapevine.American Airlines Captain Bob Steven was one of four passengers on Mr. Griffin’s bus as it was bound for an employee parking lot. Having just concluded a three-day trip, he was admittedly daydreaming about going for a bike ride when he heard a “tremendous bang” and felt the bus jump off the pavement.Captain Steven immediately noticed that the windshield had shattered, but the bus was still rolling forward. So he jumped up and started moving toward the driver, saying, “Stop the bus! Stop the bus!”Mr. Griffin was almost reclined, with his hands off the steering wheel and his feet off the pedals. Captain Steven grabbed the wheel and stuck his right foot between Mr. Griffin’s legs so he could hit the brake. As he stopped the bus, Captain Steven saw a pipe sticking through the windshield. But it wasn’t until the bus stopped moving that he noticed all of the blood on Mr. Griffin’s sweater. The pipe had impaled his neck.“His eyes were still open, but they were starting to roll back, and he was kind of waving his hand up toward his throat,” Captain Steven says in a video released today by the Allied Pilots Association, the certified collective bargaining agent for all American Airlines pilots.Relying on his Air Force training, Captain Steven used the heel of his hand to apply pressure to Mr. Griffin’s wound. The other three passengers had gotten off the bus, so he yelled for them to call 911 as he tried to raise a dispatcher on the bus’s radio. Captain Steven repeatedly told Mr. Griffin to keep breathing, and he continued applying pressure to the wound until a paramedic arrived to relieve him.Mr. Griffin has undergone two surgeries — one to repair his carotid artery and another to remove a piece of pipe that was stuck in his neck. That’s why the Allied Pilots Association has set up a Go Fund Me account on his behalf.“Knowing the right thing to do is easy. The hard part for most people is simply doing the right thing,” said First Officer Jon “Josey” Wales, who represents Captain Steven and nearly 2,900 other DFW-based pilots on the Allied Pilots Association’s board of directors as their domicile vice chairman. “We are all surrounded by managers every day in our career.

I would like to join my 6th grade classmates this summer on an educational trip to the east coast and hope I can raise enough funds to go. I would love to go on this trip because I am a HUGE history geek and a big fan of Hamilton: An American Musical, which inspired me to learn more about the American Revolution and the history of our founding fathers. Please help me raise funds by donating here or by purchasing some of my handmade items I will have available soon. Thank you for your support!Sincerely,Ember IsabeloAnyone else have an 11 year old daughter who squeals in excitement at the mention of visiting the Library of Congress? My daughter Ember has always been fascinated with history and has an opportunity to go on an incredible journey to learn about the history of our nation. We are so proud of her educational accomplishments and scholarships that enable her to attend a reputable private school. This summer program, however, is not covered by her scholarships so we are seeking help for funding. The itinerary (in more detail below) covers east coast stays in Virginia, Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York city with a comprehensive list of tours and activities from learning about the birth of the nation, military and war history, politics and law to seeing a Broadway shows and a New York Mets baseball game. Here is an excerpt from her history teacher who encouraged Ember to apply for this trip: “Ember Isabelo is any teacher’s dream! She is full of energy and wit and always has a friendly word to say. I am delighted with her efforts in Social Studies. She shows a strong understanding of the Civil War and its aftermath as evidenced by her two major exams. Her reading skills are strong….[I] feel so lucky to be getting to travel with her to the east coast this summer.”Williamsburg, VAJamestown GlasshouseColonial Williamsburg tourYorktown tourJamestown Living History tourCharlottesville, VAMonticello -Thomas Jefferson’s PlantationMichie TavernWashington, D.C.Jefferson MemorialMLK MemorialFDR MemorialCapitol Hill TourSupreme CourtLibrary of CongressSmithsonian’s National Air & Space MuseumArlington National CemeteryKennedy CenterNewseumWashington MonumentWhite HouseFord’s Theater & Petersen HouseHolocaust MuseumLincoln MemorialKorean War MemorialVietnam Veterans War MemorialMount Vernon – George Washington’s PlantationSmithsonian InstitutePentagon MemorialIwo Jima MemorialPhiladelphia, PALiberty BellReading TerminalPhiladelphia Historic Walking TourIndependence HallBen Franklin Print ShopWilliam Pen StatuePhiladelphia Ghost TourNew York CityNational 9/11 MemorialBroadway ShowCentral ParkRockefeller CenterStatue of Liberty & Ellis IslandTenement MuseumWall Street & Financial DistrictNew York Mets baseball gameTimes SquareBroadway Show #2What a list!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/jackbrown,"""Rock Out For Jack"" Fundraiser","Dear Friends,I hope this message finds you well.We are planning, organizing, and hosting a “Rock Out For Jack” fundraising event for our son and brother, Jack. And we would love to share our storied journey with you.Jack was born with several severe disabilities and life-limiting conditions. He requires around-the-clock nursing care. His mom hasn't been able to work since Jack was born, as she is Jack's primary nurse. We are without private insurance. The costs of his life sustaining supplies alone (tracheostomy & enteral feeding) are astronomical.Jack is a 9-year-old boy who was born with CHARGE Syndrome; a rare and life-limiting disorder that arises during early fetal development & affects multiple organ systems. Jack is Tracheostomy dependent, has a feeding tube insertion and is deaf. He has had 19 surgeries to date (#20 coming soon). Jack has had numerous admissions to CHEO totaling over 2 years, and he also requires 24-hour nursing care. The fundraising event will occur on Saturday September 28th, 2019, at The Lieutenant’s Pump British Pub, located here in downtown Ottawa at 361 Elgin Street.We will be operating a public Silent Auction event on Facebook on our “Rock Out For Jack’s” page. All donors are gratefully acknowledged on this public event, and a link to their Facebook page and website will also be incorporated.https://www.facebook.com/Rock-Out-For-Jack-302178110388006/We would be ever so grateful if you were able to kindly support our family, with a gift-in-kind donation for our silent auction.We also have a GoFundMe link available:www.gofundme.com/jackbrownOur intentions for 2019 are to apply as an exhibitor to several local festivals throughout the year, ending the festival season with a fundraiser/silent auction party with a date of Saturday September 28th.I have applied to the many fairs and festivals around the Ottawa area, for a possibility of being a charitable vendor exhibitor. While many have yet to finalize concession details, I'm proud to note that The Ottawa Beer Fest has welcomed “Rock Out For Jack” with open arms (www.ottawabeerfest.com). This is one of the first festivals of the year (May 10th & 11th) and several thousand craft beer lovers are expected to attend.We had an amazing time last year participating in two music festivals (RebelFest & Calabogie Blues & Ribfest). Our booth was well received by everyone. We handed out over 2000 bottles of water (donations were optional and were gratefully accepted). We also hosted a guitar raffle (poster attached) which was a fabulous attraction for concert goers.Our intent for this coming year is to host a guitar raffle yet again, but for this occasion we would love to raffle off 4 high-end electric guitars, as well as provide “Swag Bags” for festival-goers to purchase.Planning for this year’s “Rock Out For Jack” is in its infancy stage, and we want to ask you if you would be interested in collaborating or partnering with Jack, by donating bulk items to help fill our Swag Bags.I can offer you in return many forms of advertising that will reach several thousand people in the Ottawa area, which includes news media (newsprint, radio, and television), social media, direct email campaign, and posters, banners, flyers, ... I would also be more than happy to promote your business to festival attendees. Some ideas are promoting new or first-to-market items, advertise in-store specials, or provide bounce back coupons to everyone who visits our booth.A local printing company located here in Kanata, AMBROTEK, has provided, and will continue to deliver, all the graphics, signage, tent canopy, banners, business cards... for all of Rock Out For Jack's fundraising/auction/festival needs since its inception, at absolutely no charge. AMBROTEK has extended their gracious offer for 2019 to include all businesses who are part of “Rock Out For Jack’s” network.www.ambrotek.comWe could design, print, and get thousands of bounce back coupons into the hands of local festival goers.I have attached Jack’s fundraising letter and event flyer for your perusal.If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please reach out to me at your convenience. I will be more than happy to answer.With love – Greg Brown, Susan, Elizabeth & Jack419 Montserrat StreetStittsville ONK2S 0L6613-808-2169gregorybrown@live.ca The following fundraising letter was composed by Jack’s sister, Elizabeth:Rock Out For Jack Fundraiser & Silent AuctionDear Friends,I am writing to you on behalf of my 9-year-old brother and my Dad. I would love to share our storied journey with you.Jack was born in June of 2009 with many severe disabilities and life-limiting conditions. He is medically fragile and requires 24-hour nursing care. Jack was born with an uncommon syndrome named CHARGE. This syndrome is the leading cause of blind-deafness in children.  Jack is deaf, with some vision impairment. He has a tracheostomy and a feeding tube. And he is mostly confined to a wheelchair (although he took his first unassisted steps recently at school (we never knew if Jack would ever be able to walk). Jack was also recently diagnosed with severe autism; less than the first percentile. We have never heard Jack’s voice. I cannot wait for the day I hear his first words. We’ve never been able to snuggle with Jack at night. He is hooked up to 4 machines periodically throughout the night. Jack’s mom has not been employable since Jack’s birth as she is not only his mom, but his nurse who has been trained by the staff at CHEO to care for Jack and to use life-saving measures if necessary.Jack was admitted to CHEO on November 8th for his 19th surgery. He has unfortunately spent over 2 years at CHEO altogether. CHEO has been like a 2nd home for our family.Exactly 3 months after Jack was born my dad was diagnosed with guarded, high risk Melanoma, with a 6-month prognosis. Jack was in the midst of a 3-month hospital stay when Dad was diagnosed. Since both his mom and dad were trained to care for Jack, they split 24 hour rotating shifts at his bedside. That was the toughest, most emotional few months that we have ever endured. My dad tried not to break down as he held Jack, but knowing he would grow up without a father was too much to grasp. The CHEO team saw our emotional struggles, and set us up with a social worker at the hospital. We’ve been met with love and compassion throughout our entire experience with CHEO.My dad remained in hospital for 3 weeks after his first surgery. The good thing was that the 2 hospitals were connected by a tunnel. Jack’s mom spent her days running back and forth between the two hospitals.In December 2015 my dad was hit with a major depression disorder (Doctors expected it to happen much sooner). Walking on eggshells with his health and his son’s fragilities, the recent passing of his father, added pressure at work, and a marital breakdown with Jack’s mom resulted in a significant decline in his mental health. On a positive note, the duration Dad has remained at home helped him develop a bond with Jack that is much stronger than we could ever pray for. He has truly enjoyed being a stay-at-home dad for this exact reason. Unfortunately, Dad has had to resign from work as a result of the physical and emotional scars left behind by cancer, which left him broken, beat, and scarred. Unfortunately, he will never be in remission, but he made a promise to us that he will continue to fight!Because of dad’s illness, and mom being Jack’s full-time nurse, they are without private insurance. Although there is some support from government affiliated agencies, the out-of-pocket expenses for Jack’s care are astronomical. Life sustaining supplies and equipment (tracheostomy & enteral feeding supplies) are roughly $34,000/year and incontinence supplies are $5,400, which is a portion of the cost of raising a medically fragile child. Although Jack still faces a morbidity/mortality rate he continues to enjoy life with enthusiasm.To our friends, we are graciously hoping for your support for this upcoming benefit fundraiser for Jack, and we are gratefully accepting gifts in-kind to benefit a silent auction leading up to the event.If you have any questions, comments or concerns please feel free to contact me at your convenience.Thank you for reading.Elizabeth Brown and family (Greg, Susan, and Jack)419 Montserrat StreetStittsville ON K2S0L6613-808-2169Elizabeth.brown1@hotmail.comgregorybrown@live.cawww.gofundme.com/jackbrownYou can find us on Facebook: “Rock Out For Jack”https://www.facebook.com/Rock-Out-For-Jack-302178110388006/Here is a brief clip of Jack, compliments of Campus Creative & Barterpay Ottawahttps://vimeo.com/281531283/80f6b381ce",https://images.gofundme.com/h98nCn8f9xG5JfOotg1GE4B-Teg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17174606_1552915650524051_r.jpeg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Team fundraiserGreg Brown and Mark Da Silva are organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,155 raised of $20,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/jaz-fievel-medical-fund,2 ACD Rescues Need Surgery,"Fievel and Jaz were rescued from shelters by Carolina ACD Rescue & Rebound in late 2016. CACDRR is committed to our foster dogs and will always make sure they are fully vetted and all health issues or injuries are treated before listing them for adoption. Every now and then, we are hit hard in the pocketbook by vet costs. That’s the situation we find ourselves in now with Fievel and Jaz. Fievel is a super nice boy who loves being with his foster parents and K9 brother. He was surrendered to a rural GA shelter by his owners and we rescued him. He came to us limping badly on his left hind leg, and after a consult with a vet and x-rays, we discovered he has BBs and shrapnel his leg, and his hip is in pretty bad shape. He will need surgery to correct these issues. Initial estimates for his treatment start at $2,000.00.Jaz came to us with a couple of serious health problems. She has a terribly painful skin condition and her back end is broken either due to abuse or being hit by a car. Her foster mom has been able to manage the skin condition to a point with some natural remedies, meds, baths, massages and a good natural food. It seems like it’s getting better but will then get worse than before. She's in pain most of the time, runs a fever, and hurts all over. We’ve scheduled her for more tests but the doctors now are thinking an auto immune disease and/or severe allergies. Jaz not only needs extensive testing to diagnose her skin condition (then hopefully effective treatment!), but will also need surgery on her back end. Rough estimates for initial diagnosis and surgery are $2,000.00 - $3,000.00.Both of these fur kids deserve not only to be pain-free, but to find their very own Forever Homes, and we will make sure that happens regardless. But we could sure use your help! Thank you!Carolina ACD Rescue & Rebound is dedicated to helping Australian Cattle Dogs in need of rescue in North and South Carolina. Through our foster home program, these dogs receive routine veterinary care, training, and lots of TLC until they go to their new Forever Homes.  We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization so all donations are tax deductable, and all donors will receive a donation letter for their records.",https://images.gofundme.com/cmnWYDAYK6PcKDKm6qWFNxIkg84=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17174696_1489847367.6169.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Laurey McElroy is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Carolina ACD R&R.,Animals & Pets,"$3,020 raised of $4,000 goal"

He degloved his foot (also fractures) resulting in long hospital stay with multiple surgeries. There was a high risk of infection and amputation. Jordan not only needed screws and plates but skin, muscle and tissue graft from his right thigh to repair his foot and then a skin graft from his left thigh to repair his right thigh! A very painful complex surgery and recovery! Jordan's grafted muscle and tissue had to relearn how to behave in intense physiotherapy. Although it had been tough emotionally (lots of ups and downs), as Jordan also had to spend Christmas and the New Year in hospital. He's a naturally positive and cheerful person and is working hard with the doctors and physiotherapists to achieve the best outcome. Much love and thanks to his family and good mates for their support and keeping his spirits up. For Jordan to be able to get multiple appointmments for specialists and physics to closely monitor medical progress. He needs a reliable automatic car as his left foot is unable to work a clutch in a manual car and living out of town means limited transport options. Jordan was a first year apprentice which unfortunately had gone suspended as he is unable to work until he has medical clearance which could be some time. As his girlfriend, I have seen how tough it has been for him so I'm hoping to raise funds for Jordan to get a good reliable car to ease one worry for him.

January 1, 2017 5:54 PMBRIDGEPORT - Members of the Bridgeport City Council spoke out Sunday in support of a severely disabled woman.They say because of her immigration status she can't get the medical treatment she needs to survive.Hanna Peart, 35, is living with lupus and her mother says she is a prisoner in her own home.The disease is so debilitating that Peart cannot get up the stairs to her room where she lives with her 4-year old daughter. The disease has also caused Peart to be unable to continue her college education and she can no longer work. Peart, who is originally from Jamaica, is undocumented, so she cannot get state medical insurance and cannot afford to pay for health care. The family says the attorney they were paying to get Peart’s green card was arrested for fraud and then was deported. Peart’s mother says if her daughter is deported back to Jamaica, she will almost certainly die due to the country's inferior medical care. Bridgeport City Councilman Jack Banta says Peart has ""contributed to this country, she's went to school in this country, and has played by the rules."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal says he is working to see how Peart can get the help she needs.",https://images.gofundme.com/IegDK-8m_ION5HZvWpcyYdGXvIc=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17175170_14834972100_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Hanna Peart is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,900 raised of $39,000 goal"

His team of doctors who have been treating him for many many years have now  said that they have done all that they can do for him and that his organs are failing."" I have always known as his mother, that men are limited as to what they can do. God is not limited as to what he will do. I believe that the Lord will undo all that the Devil has done to Maurice.(Ps103:1-3) { who healeth  all thy diseases} ""The Lord told me that Maurice is already healed, and I truly believe the Lord with all of my heart.....We were recently on a conference call with Dr. Gaveck from LosAngeles C.A.He is head of one of the leading stem cell therapy programs in the United States. Even though Maurice's case is extremely complicated, Dr.Gaveck is willing to take on Maurice's case and do whatever it takes to free him from Sickle Cell Anemia. Dr.Gaveck will perform 4 sets of stem cell treaments over the course of 4 months. Eventually his organs will heal themselves. The treatments will start as soon as possible. Maurice is a strong believer in Christ and wants to fulfill his destiny by leaving a legacy in life with his beloved, Corina. He is one of the strongest and most  courageous young men I know. He has fought and won many many battles thoughout his life. One of his favorite quotes are (""It's  not how  hard you can hit. It's  about how many times you get hit and keep moving forward. That is how winning is done."") Maurice has such a strong will for life. Maurice's father Mike and I have always hoped and dreamed that one day they would find a cure for sickle cell and that he would live a normal life Hallelujah!!!  Our prayers are answered.     ""This one is for you T-Bone Mike, God rest your soul""                 I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES We are asking for your help.

Crissy has been a part of the Relay Family forever.  A Mahopac girl her whole life, Crissy began fighting cancer at the Mahopac Relay.  She soon joined the planning committee and became an Event Lead.  Crissy was usually spotted in the middle of the turf leading a dance, doing Zumba, and making sure that everyone present was having a wonderful time.  As a Survivor Crissy embodies everything that we raise funds for-to find a cure for a disease that we all hate.  Crissy realized early on that Caregivers were an important and often overlooked part of Relay.  Her work on recognizing Caregivers led the nation and set an example for others to follow.  Several years ago Crissy decided to Relay in her new hometown and became a driving force on the Patterson Relay planning committee.  Still dancing!  This fall Crissy got an early start on her fundraising and was the inspiration behind our King of the Wing fundraiser-perhaps Queen of the Wing being more appropriate.  Crissy has always been there when we needed her and now it is time for us to be there for her.  Due to the nature of her illness, Crissy needs to be treated at Mass General.  Boston is far from home and even with the help she will get from the American Cancer Society, Crissy will need our help.  We are setting up this Go Fund Me for Crissy so that her family can be with her during surgery and during her very long recovery.  Days in Boston are days without a paycheck for those that love Crissy.  Boston is a very expensive city.  Crissy is always helping others and honestly was a little shy about accepting this help.  I am asking that we show her that she is not alone.  Any amount that you can donate will help.  Prayers and love and hope will help too.  Crissy would love to hear from you, her email address is musicinmysoul24@aol.comThank you and God Bless.",https://images.gofundme.com/3TAV_xDlJ3WxBMLtQNdU_kJWW40=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17175680_1483487714.0179.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Romykay Hajkowski is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Crissy Hajkowski.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$4,425 raised of $10,000 goal"

I cannot express enough gratitude for this tremendous support that I have received from you and MHC sisters.

This coming semester I will be starting my last year of college at Mount Holyoke. Unfortunately, my family is currently in difficult financial straits. My father’s income has declined and we are in a dire economic situation. While my parents try desperately to make ends meet, some of my college tuition goes unpaid. If we can’t make the payment to Mount Holyoke in time I may be forced to leave the school.I have been incredibly active in the Mount Holyoke community and currently serve as the Secretary of the Student Government, a position I will likely be forced to leave in order to take a job. I also just completed an internship Congressman McGovern’s Office. Academically, I am on track to graduate magna cum laude. My goal after I graduate is to work to improve the conditions of working-class people who are less fortunate than I am. But, right now, I am the one in need of assistance. It is with great regret that I ask for your help in paying the tuition. Every penny counts. Please give what you can, no matter how small an amount.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mission-trip-to-thailandcambodia,Mission Trip to Thailand/Cambodia,"Dear Family and Friends,As you very well know, for years I have had a heart for traveling the world, for learning and immersing myself in other cultures, and for sharing my faith with those who have never heard the name of Jesus Christ.I have this very opportunity next year. I am traveling with five other people from West Hill’s college ministry to Thailand and Cambodia. There, we will partner with Sending Hope International helping to prevent young girls from being engulfed in the horrific sex slave trade that ravages the area, teaching them the Bible and creating relationships through a week-long camp-like program. Though all girls are beautiful and important in the eyes of God, this group is particularly special. You see, they don’t have Thai citizenship. If and when girls are taken into the sex slave trade, they become like styrofoam cups. When used up, they are disposed of, forgotten, and forever lost. I realize this is a graphic and crude metaphor, but it’s their reality. Lack of citizenship also means they can’t work, which means they can’t make money, which means they can’t provide for themselves or their families, let alone pay for education. And Sending Hope is working to save as many girls from this fate as possible.Sending Hope International, an organization started by Dave Atkins and his wife, Joyce — locals to Lexington, Ohio — locates and rescues these girls and teaches them the Word of God, feeds, clothes, educates them, teaches them to play an instrument (a vital asset when looking for work), as well as covers their medical needs.This is something I’ve prayed about and want to take part in. The trip cost is $2,500, which covers flights, housing, and food for the two weeks I’ll be there.I’m writing you to ask for help in raising this money, and most importantly for prayer.

To which I replied, ""Well, yes.  I am really sorry but...""  There she was smiling from ear to ear, ""That's great!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-michaels-battle-with-cancer,Support Michaels Battle with Cancer,"As many of you are aware, the holidays brought devastating news to our family. My brother, Michael Uhl was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Michael was experiencing unimaginable pain in his right thigh/back and a visit to his physical therapist led to a trip to the ER, where they discovered a very large 6cm tumor sitting on his kidney. From Vail he was taken by ambulance to the Denver hospital to be treated by the best doctors. The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, one lung, and a lesion on a bone. His severely swollen leg carried 12 extra lbs of fluid from the tumor blocking the lymph nodes, not allowing the leg to rid itself of the excess fluid. Soon after receiving this heartbreaking news, Michael started an aggressive chemotherapy treatment, 3 drugs for 5 straight days, which requires him to stay in the hospital because he was born with only 1 kidney. His kidney has to be continuously monitored to make sure the chemo doesn't damage it. As a result, Michael and his girlfriend Leslie will not be able to return to their jobs in Vail and will remain in the Denver area to be near the hospital. Michael begins his second week long chemo treatment today and has only been out of the hospital for 2 days since December 7th, after suffering many complications following the first round of chemo.Many have asked how they could help, so I've created this page in hopes of raising money for him to offset any costs he faces in the long and difficult road ahead. Every little bit helps tremendously. Michael can beat this, but he needs your help. All donations will help mitigate treatment costs and help him navigate the road to recovery, while serving as an enduring reminder that people near and far are thinking of him.We appreciate all your loving prayers, kind blessings and unyielding support. Please help us spread the word by sharing this link.

She started chemotherapy in May 2016, and in July at a follow-up, the cancer had grown by 20%, and she was not a candidate for the one surgery that could potentially add many years to her life.  Her chemo regimen was changed, and she underwent chemo until 9 Dec. Patty continued to work as long as she could, saving the lives of others ironically ;), until Aug; and this amazing mother of two decided it was time to spend her every moment with her children and her family. On December 30th, Patty underwent  what some call the  ""mother of all surgeries,"" the most aggressive form of treatment for those with advanced abdominal cancer. Cytoreductive surgery combined with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC)  is a targeted treatment approach where tumors that have spread through the lining of the abdomen are removed and then heated chemotherapy is perfused throughout the abdomen, with the intent of killing any remaining cancer cells that may be present after all visible disease has been removed surgically.Patty was more at peace prior to the surgery than I had seen her in a very long time. She had her prayer notebook, and knew that this was in God's hands.  Complete peace, and for that I am thankful. As you can imagine, this surgery has been, and will be very taxing on Patty's body, and recovery will be long-term. She is also required to remain in Houston for several weeks following the surgery, to ensure her healing and safety. What we are doing is raising money so Patty and her family can focus on her recovery, and not worry about the lack of income, bills, cost of surgery/recovery, etc.  No one can prepare for the financial burden of something so life-changing...Patty has a special place in our hearts, and she is definitely not one to ask for help, she is always the one giving, and doing for others. But any and all support is very much appreciated! If you have it in your heart to give a little or a lot, she would appreciate it beyond measure.  I know she will likely be posting updates regarding her recovery as soon as she is able!",https://images.gofundme.com/e-27cJSw7bMjDW4XBQMbYzcjyKk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176122_1483491675.5322.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176122_1483501988.2799_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176122_1483502800.0756_funddescription.jpeg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176122_1483502855.0717_funddescription.jpeg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176122_1483501735.9496_funddescription.jpeg']",4,"Created January 3, 2017",Patricia Thurgood is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Patricia Thurgood.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,435 raised of $15,000 goal"

The break was so bad that I have had to endure an external fixator for 3 weeks and 3 surgeries to repair my leg. At the moment I am in a cast and able to get around with the use of crutches but cannot put any weight on my leg. While I am able to move around I cannot work or do simple tasks like walk my dog, go grocery shopping, drive to the doctor, cook or do house chores. My profession is bar tending and that has been put on hold for 8 months to a year while I heal.  What I am asking for help with is medical expenses and support for my recovery time. I will not be able to bear weight on my leg until March at the very earliest. After that I begin my long journey of physical therapy which will take another 5-6 months.  During this time I will not be able to work which means I am not taking in any money and have not been since my accident in late November. I have some medical expenses that were not covered by insurance along with everyday expenses such as a mortgage, utilities, food, etc. Here is what I have been through so far. The first surgery was to put an external fixator on with two bars. The second surgery 1 week later added a third bar. The third surgery removed the external fixator and put the puzzle pieces that were my leg back together using 18 screws and 2 plates. I also have an ulcer on my heal that was created during my ER visit which is slowing my recovery process.

We are three passionate female pilots who are going to fly from Santa Barbara to Maryland to compete in the Air Race Classic . The Air Race Classic was started in 1929 as the first air race for women pilots. In the last 85 years the Air Race has stood as a pillar event for women in aviation. Like the founders of the first Women's Air Derby in 1929, we are passionate about aviation and encouraging women and girls to learn how to fly. The opportunity to fly in the Air Race Classic is an incredible achievement in itself and we wouldn't feel safe without having received thorough training at Above All Aviation.This summer we are embarking on a cross-country flight from Santa Barbara, CA (KSBA) to Frederick, MD (KFDK) to participate in the Air Race Classic. The Air Race is an opportunity for women pilots to fly together and increase visibility of women in aviation. In addition to the Air Race which is nearly 2,000NM, our flights to and from the race will put nearly 6,000miles and 60 hours of flight time in our logbooks. OUR GOAL is to reach as many young women as possible along our route by raising awareness and promoting women in aviation. The race stops are our way of connecting with communities across the country and sharing our enthusiasm for aviation everywhere we go! Women make up just 6% of the pilot population worldwide and visibility is key for inspiring the next generation of female pilots.The funds we require will cover our registration fees, fuel to, from, and during the race, as well as accomodations during our adventure. Above All Aviation is generously donating the use of the airplane to, from, and during the Air Race. These costs total $12,000.This is an opportunity for any person or business who believes in the power of women following their dreams to support us. As a business, your support of $500 or more will be showcased all across the country on our race shirts and advertised on decals on our Cessna 182. Our sponsors are a crucial part of our team. Together we will inspire thousands of young women in 10 states to pursue their dreams and reach for the skies, regardless of obstacles.

Tricia Gentile has been my best friend (closer to a sister) for 17 years now.  Her family is my family and my family is her family, and with that being said, Tricia's father, our Captain, is my Captain as well.  He has treated me like a second daughter, and if you know him he probably has treated you like family too.  From cutting down Christmas trees to eating cannolis on Arthur Avenue, most of my childhood memories involve the Captain.  He has the biggest heart, and is always there to help anyone in any way that he can. Now, I want to give back to him for everything he has ever done for me. Six years ago, the Captain started this unfortunate journey when he was diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. After going through countless months of intense chemo and radiation, and 10 surgeries, he thankfully went into remission 3 years later. Unfortunately, December of 2015, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-operable, non-small cell lung cancer. The cancer has spread to his liver, lymph nodes, and GI tract. The past three months in particular have been extremely difficult. He underwent three surgeries in seven weeks that were life threatening. He is still fighting an aggressive infection in his GI tract that has inhibited his ability to walk. Luckily he pulled through, however, has not been home in three months and was forced to spend the holidays in the hospital.  Currently, the Captain has recently been transferred to a Rehab Facility where he can learn how to walk again. He has started chemotherapy in hopes of shrinking the tumors while also being treated to help stop the spread of the infection. It is very tricky with both the cancer and the infection being so aggressive, however there are many wonderful doctors on his team giving him the best care possible. As you may know, the Captain would never ask for any sort of donation for his cause which is why we have decided to keep this a secret from him. However, with him being sick it has been nearly impossible to keep up with all the expenses and the tremendous amount of outstanding and continuous medical bills. As you can imagine, this illness has also been very difficult for the Gentile Family physically and emotionally. That being said, his wife, Wendy, and Trish would love to help in any way they could. This is why I have created this page, for my best friend and her family to help, even in the smallest way, take the worry of money off their shoulders which shouldn't even be a concern to them during this very difficult time. The Captain truly is an amazing, big-hearted man and a wonderful father figure in many lives. He is a great husband, ""life coach,"" best friend and of course, pilot.  For the Captain, any amount of donation would truly be a huge help in so many ways. Trish, her family and I are all so grateful that people would even take the time to read his story and donate to this cause. As always, and most importantly, we ask for you to continue to keep the Captain in your prayers.

Being the last of both of our families to be married and have children, we have seen firsthand the joys and blessings it brings to raise a family. The desire to grow a loving family has always been on our hearts. However, after facing fertility issues we didn’t know what that was going to look like for us. With the highs and lows of doctor appointments and closed doors we were left looking for other options. We felt, if our family was going to grow, it was going to come from something different. That’s when we first started thinking about adoption.  If we were to fast forward to where we are now, it’s easy for us to tell you why we are going to adopt. For every door that was closed followed an opened one, leading us to where we are. When we look back on what Jesus did for us, it doesn’t compare to what we could do for someone else. God has adopted us into His kingdom, and we are to love and take care of those who are less fortunate.As we start this journey to adopt, we ask that you first pray for us. Pray, that God guides us with His patience and will as we go through this process. Pray also for the birth mom and child. That God will direct her heart and keep her safe. There’s no greater gift than your prayers. God has placed adoption on our hearts, and as we know, there will be many emotional and financial challenges to meet us along the way.Knowing that adoption costs can be upwards of $40,000, our goal is to raise $20,000. The funds will be going towards our home study, agency applications, lawyer fees and travel expenses. We also plan to apply for grants and hope to have a number of different fundraisers. We know that if this is where we are meant to be, our needs will be provided for.

The surgeon who called her said that right now, they are just trying to save his life. It started in his foot, but has traveled to his groin as of now. They think that he contracted it from surfing in the ocean. Details of the infection are listed below.My brother is currently in California. My mom booked a flight at a cost of $1000. She would never ask, but I know that after Christmas, and having to have her car worked on, they can not afford this.  Korey will have to have several surgeries to remove all the infection, so my mom will have to be there for awhile. She will have to take unpaid time off of her job and have to stay at the hospital hotel if they have one, or a local hotel. I know that everyone is recooperating after Christmas, but if we all can share just a little bit, it can help out a lot. And most importantly, please keep my brother in your prayers. Taken from WebMD:Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection caused by bacteria. It can destroy skin, fat, and the tissue covering the muscles within a very short time.The disease sometimes is called flesh-eating bacteria.Necrotizing fasciitis is very rare but serious. About 1 out of 4 people who get this infection die from it.You can get necrotizing fasciitis when bacteria enter a wound, such as from an insect bite, a burn, or a cut. You can also get it in:Wounds that come in contact with ocean water, raw saltwater fish, or raw oysters, including injuries from handling sea animals such as crabs.An intestinal surgery site, or in tumors or gunshot injuries in the intestines.A muscle strain or bruise, even if there is no break in the skin.The infection may spread rapidly. It quickly can become life-threatening. You may go into shock and have damage to skin, fat, and the tissue covering the muscles. (This damage is called gangrene.) Necrotizing fasciitis can lead to organ failure and death.Early treatment of necrotizing fasciitis is critical. The sooner treatment begins, the more likely you will recover from the infection and avoid serious complications, such as limb amputation or death. You may be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital.Treatment may include:Surgery that removes infected tissue and fluids to stop the spread of infection. Surgery is almost always needed. Most people need several surgeries to control the infection. Removing limbs (amputation) or organs may be done to save the person's life, depending on how severe the infection is and where it has spread.Medicines (such as antibiotics). These kill the bacteria causing the infection.Procedures to treat complications such as shock, breathing problems, and organ failure.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy.",https://images.gofundme.com/HXFAMiKKhl_-rcxndXv_uB6KWjI=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176936_1483490939.1327.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176936_1483491531.7661_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17176936_1483491487.0423_funddescription.png']",2,"Created January 3, 2017",Denise Ollanketo is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Sheila Sprague.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,380 raised of $2,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevinbooth,Kevin Booth's Medical Fund,"This fund was created by the family of Kevin Booth to help raise money for Kevin to travel to South Florida for an extensive, high risk surgery to reverse his ileostomy (more commonly known by most as a colostomy) and for reconstructive surgery to build a new colon. At the age of 25, Kevin was diagnosed with Severe Chronic Ulcerative Colitis by his GI Specialist. He lived with constant daily abdominal pain that was unrelieved by pain medication, nausea, and bloody diarrhea multiple times a day. His disease progressed rapidly, and he became increasingly sicker, having issues with low hemoglobin and requiring multiple hospitalizations for multiple blood transfusions, colonoscopies and other tests, as well as many trials of different medications to help manage his pain, inflammation and bleeding. He did not have much success with most of the common Ulcerative Colitis (UC) meds, and was then started on very expensive IV infusion medication, all which were not successful in helping with managing his UC. After approximately one year or so of living with the daily chronic, debilitating pain, bloody stools, loss of appetite, weakness and lethargy, as well as almost weekly trips to the ER and hospitalizations, Kevin was unable to continue working fulltime. He had no energy, no appetite, especially knowing that any and all food he ate would turn into bloody diarrhea. He was tired and short of breath all the time due to his low hemoglobin levels. He made numerous trips to the bathroom for long periods of time. He began to rapidly lose weight from not being able to eat or sustain what he ate. He was suffering from malnutrition. Kevin lost over 100 lbs. in just less than one year’s time. At that time, he was living in the hospital more than he was at home. His doctors and specialists were unsure how to further help Kevin. They had tried all the treatments and medications that were available but were unsuccessful. His GI Specialist was in the process of making arrangements to send Kevin to another specialist at the Univ of Florida when Kevin was readmitted to the hospital again for his UC. Kevin was often visited in the hospital by a very special GI Nurse Practitioner, Holly Adams, who always went above and beyond with helping Kevin during his hospitalizations. The GI Specialist was in the process of making arrangements for an ambulance to transport Kevin to Shands Hospital at the University of Florida. They were hoping to have him admitted and treated by a GI Specialist there as they were not quite sure what further treatment they could offer Kevin. At this point, Kevin was down to 118 lbs., very sick and weak, and unable to care for himself any longer. After what was supposed to be a routine visit from Holly, ARNP, before transporting Kevin to the ambulance, Holly noticed a foul odor on Kevin’s breath and sent him for a CT scan. It was noted on his CT scan that he had a ruptured colon and his body was septic, which can be fatal. He was immediately rushed into emergency surgery, where it was found his colon had ruptured due to the chronic bleeding and inflammation caused by his UC. At that time, the surgeons were not even sure if Kevin would survive. By the grace of God and the amazing care Kevin received from the physicians, ARNPs, nurses and staff at Baptist Hospital in Pensacola, FL, Kevin spent almost two weeks in ICU and almost two more months in the hospital recovering from his surgery. His colon was so damaged and not repairable that he had to receive an ileostomy (or colostomy with a colostomy bag). He was unable to walk for many weeks afterwards, requiring physical therapy to help rebuild muscle and regain his strength back. He required total care. Over time, he made some improvements. Over the last couple of years, Kevin has been able to regain his independence, gain and sustain a healthy weight and been able to work again. However, it was later discovered that Kevin was dealt another bad hand. During a scheduled colonoscopy and endoscopy procedure to see if Kevin would be a candidate to have his ileostomy reversed, it was then discovered that Kevin also suffers from Chron’s disease. Chron’s disease is also a chronic inflammatory disease that is not curable and causes pain, bleeding and inflammation to the GI tract, similar to Ulcerative Colitis, but they are two different diseases. He was given medications to try to help control and manage the inflammation and bleeding caused to other parts of his GI tract from the Chron’s. His doctors prescribed different medications, but none seemed to work. He was later started on trials of IV infusion meds, which seemed to be helping. His local GI Specialist was optimistic and referred Kevin to GI Surgery Specialists. Kevin has seen multiple specialists, and his most recent trip to see the GI Specialists and The University of Alabama has now turned into a surgery consultation in January 2017 with a GI Surgery Specialist in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Kevin has come a long way since being diagnosed with both of these diseases. We are looking forward to him being able to have surgery to reverse his ileostomy, which can hopefully return him to having a much more normal life, a life that every 30 year old should be able to have. No more colostomy bags! No more constant trips to the bathroom to empty the colostomy bag! No more worrying about being out in public and if the bag leaks or bursts! He will still always live with and have to continue to help manage these diseases as neither are curable but treatable. Kevin is considered a very high risk patient due to his extensive medical history with both diseases. As a family, we are trying to help financially as much as we can, but the surgery he needs is very, very expensive and the amount of time Kevin will be away from work could be lengthy. This surgery will require a lot of time off from work and multiple trips, not only for Kevin but for our family as well, to South Florida for pre-op appointments, surgery, and multiple post-operative appointments. Any additional support and assistance from family and friends is greatly appreciated not only by Kevin, but from our family as well.

He was 84 years old and preceded in death by his wife Jeanette. I set up this GoFundMe as a way anyone moved to can help my mom, Diana Edward, with the expenses of her father's funeral. My mom cared for my grandpa & grandma Reeves during the last 10 years of their lives, after she moved them from California to live with her in Albany, Oregon. My mom, a single mother, has always known hard work and joyfully cared for others at her own expense.The last few years has found my mom un-employed or under-employed and finances have been tight for her. In the last year, my grandpa Reeves was transitioned over to Medicaid to recieve state assistance to cover his increased medical and housing costs at the assisted-living facility he had recently moved into. This transition to Medicaid absorbed his retirement, social security income, and most other assests he had. Grandpa Reeves recently took a turn for the worst and went downhill rapidly; he died only a few weeks after being given a 6-months-to-live prognosis. So now my mom finds herself rushed to come up with the funds for an immediate burial, during an already trying time in her life financially.Please join with me in helping to ease her financial burden by contributing any amount you feel led to. Thankfully, Olson's Funeral Chapel in Sweet Home, Oregon have been really gracious and worked out low price to accomodate my mom's current situation.

My husband and I are wanting to get our nephew out of an unfit home. Our nephew was handed over by the court system to his aunt and uncle from his step father's side because his mother and stepfather were unable to care for him properly. The court system never considered placing him with biological family. He has been with this family going on 2 years now. We've heard from numerous people about the conditions of the home he is in, but finally seen it with our own eyes on December 31, 2016. The home is disgusting! Not only that, the home does not provide for his basic needs. (Unfortunately, I cannot go into specific details due to the pending custody case) The house was so bad, when my husband and I left after dropping our nephew off after an extended visit with him, I immediately called DFACS (department of family and children services). I'm hoping and praying that DFACS will follow up with my report.   So, the reason I've started this page is because we want to fight for our nephew and gain custody of him to provide him with a loving, safe, stable home. But, unfortunately, attorney fees are great. We have found an attorney who is charging us a $3500 flat rate. We need help. This little boy has seen, heard, experienced, and lived through hell in his short life thus far and it is unfair to him. We want to save him from the nightmare he is living in. Any donations we receive will be used strictly for attorney fees. Once we gain custody (we are hoping and praying for) any excess money after the attorney has been paid in full will be used strictly for our nephew to get new clothes, bedroom furnishings, etc.   Thank you in advance for your help!

Since then, it has slightly improved, but hasn't gone away.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/dana-ingrams-recovery-fund,Dana Ingram's Recovery Fund,"Dana, our sweet friend and single mother, is recovering from bacterial pneumonia. She is not even supposed to be here with us, but she is a fighter. She was checked into the hospital Friday Dec. 17th for what she thought was going to be a three day stay. By Saturday she was in ICU and by Sunday she was on life support with only a 5% chance to survive. Family and friends were called into say goodbye, but day after day she kept beating the doctors' expectations. She is such a fighter that it was hard to keep her from pulling out her breathing tube, even though she was heavily sedated. Her mother Nancy, daughters Haley and Aubrey, and all of her friends and family kept vigil knowing deep down she was far to strong-willed (mean) to let something like pneumonia stop her from being there for her children, family and freinds. Finally, on Dec. 29th, after many prayers, Dana was able to be taken off the breathing tube. She not only beat the chances the doctors gave her, but she even went home sooner than they thought possible. As of now, however, she needs rehabilitation because its difficult (due to the atrophy of her muscles) to walk and sit on her own, meaning she is unable to work. Her lungs also need more time to heal and her throat, because of the tube, is still so sore she can barely speak. She will not be able to go back to work until some time in Feburary, and though she has short-term disability, it is not nearly enough for her to cover her household and medical bills. Please help us help Dana recover without the stress of not knowing how she will take care of her kids for the next month.

He was an old school guy with a heart of gold. Odds are he has looked out for you or your belongings at some point during a TH release. I met Bob at the first release when he gave me a list of all the cans he was the looking for to round out his collection. He was very passionate in his PA beer can collection with some dating back to the 40's and 50's. For the next few months we jockey ed for first in line somewhere between 1-2pm. Imagine that!!

She returned to visit her host family for winter break. On New Years Eve, Nhu, her host mom, and two host sisters were returning home from visiting family when the vehicle they were traveling in was struck by a drunk driver. The host mother was killed, and Nhu received extensive, life-threatening injuries. Her 9-year-old host sister was in critical condition, but is beginning to recover.

My daughter Bethany was friends with Nhu when Nhu was an exchange student at PC West High School last year for their senior year. The money raised from this campaign is going directly to Nhu's parents (who live in Vietnam) to help them with any expenses incurred by this horrible tragedy  such as all of the travel expenses (of getting both parents here to Oklahoma to be with their precious daughter, before she passed,  and then getting all 3 of them back to Vietnam with Nhu's casket), and also any medical bills or expenses,  loss of income, and unfortunately Nhu's  funeral and burial expenses. Since Nhu's parents are from Vietnam, Nhu's father appointed his cousin (who lives in the USA) to withdraw the funds and send it to them in Vietnam.  The family is extremely grateful to everyone who has given to the fund and/or helped with time, money, prayers and so many acts of kindness throughout this extremely difficult ordeal.",https://images.gofundme.com/aBIq4KkkPPA1mVhANB3X1dXO0_E=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178332_1483494900.2645.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Dana Gerardy Donley is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Benny Loi.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$25,280 raised of $30,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/BringBackBrewer,Support Dr. Brewer,"Dr. John Brewer, the man who “opened” Dominion High School and has served as its one and only principal for the past 13 years, needs our help! He was placed on leave in December, 2016 and the Superintendent of Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) recommended Dr. Brewer’s termination. Based upon all available information, we found the Superintendent’s position to be unjustified and unwarranted and on March 20 the School Board agreed and voted to reinstate him as DHS Principal effective April 17, 2017!Retaining his job required Dr. Brewer to vigorously defend his position, and he retained highly qualified counsel to represent him. That process included a two day hearing before a hearing officer hired by the County, which resulted in a recommendation to the School Board that there was no cause to terminate. His attorneys did a thorough and professional job in prevailing and have documented and discounted their fees to Dr. Brewer. But for an individual to prevail against the County is difficult and time consuming and the fees will exceed $90,000.  As a member of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, Dr. Brewer received $10,000 to offset his legal expenses so we are revising our goal to cover the remaining $80,000. Our goal is to ease the financial burden Dr. Brewer and his family face in his successful bid to return to Dominion High School.

After a few test and Highline not finding anything on the CT scan, discharge papers were drawn up and pain meds were given. Highline said they could not find anything. After speaking to the nurse and reminding her again that I thought it had to do with her septic infection she had back in February due to her artery in her left arm bursting in the O.R. they took one more look at the CT and found a pocket full of fluid next to her aortic valve. She was then taken by ambulance to another hospital where they performed surgery two days later. An hour and a half after surgery my moms incion burst on the inside creating a sizable hemotoma. The Drs say that right around the time of surgery my mom had a severe stroke affecting her left side of her brain. This affected her speech, memory and the use of her right side. Over the weekend my husband notice my mom's right armwas turning grayish blue.  A test was performed and her artery in her right arm was completely blocked. My mom also does dialysis on her right side from that artery. So this means when dialysis was performs four times a week, it was pulling blood from her brain. To fix this blockage there were two possibilities: one is to try to clear the calcification out of the artery or two by pass her fischula through her neck so that she could get dialysis. Both posed risk. The surgery was done to bipass the fischula through the neck and blood started flowing which caused a rush of blood to the right side of the brain and that is what the Drs think caused the stroke to the left side. (It was like turning on a water facet). As if this were not enough in a just over two week span my mom gets an infection in her colon. My mom has been and always will be a fighter in my eyes, but she's tired of fighting.Dr's wanted me to stop dialysis two weeks ago, when the severe stroke was discovered. But, I didn't and I got to spend some very quality laughs with my mom. But, now her time has come and her wings are on order. She is comfortably laying to rest with meds until she decides to take flight. My mother has been there for so many others, I ask that if you cannot donate please just share this story.

What you might not know about Shana, is she is severely sick with a very rare syndrome that has been wrecking havoc on her life for the last two years, causing debilitating pain, unintentional weight loss, and a lot of emotional distress. Shana has  had stomach problems for years now, but was finally diagnosed correctly with Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome in June 2016.  Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome or MALS, involves the median arcuate ligament, which goes around the aorta and connects the diaphragm to the spine. When the MAL presses too tightly on the celiac artery and the celiac ganglion nerves, this causes severe abdominal pain that is worsened by eating. For Shana, she has 70% stenosis (compression) in her celiac artery and her superior mesenteric artery. These arteries are major branches of the aorta that deliver blood to the stomach, liver and other organs in the body. In August 2016, Shana found a surgeon in Washington, DC and had a laparoscopic surgery to release the median arcuate ligament from compressing the arteries. Unfortunately, the surgeon did not know enough about MALS that her nerves are still causing severe pain.  Shana continues to lose weight because everything she eats makes her so sick that she throws up and will have stomach issues.   So she refuses to eat due to how bad the pain is and what it does to her.  She’s missing days at work because the pain has her curled in the fetal position in bed. She barely can sleep and her energy and out going personality  is slowly diminishing. She’s constantly in tears trying to hold onto HOPE that she will soon be pain free. The reason for creating this page is because Shana is set to go see a top MALS surgeon who is located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He will do an open heart surgery that will cure Shana of this terrible, life altering syndrome. The surgery date was scheduled today for February 1st.   This was my Christmas wish and we all have been praying for.  Everyone who knows Shana knows that she’s very stubborn and rarely asks for help but this page is where you can help her. She will be in the hospital for 5 to 8 days and then has to stay in a hotel close to the hospital for another 7 to 10 days. With her surgery happening soon, she needs help with expenses for the hotel stay, gas, and food. Anything that you can give will be put to her travel expenses to and from Connecticut.",https://images.gofundme.com/mEQKmvB7vwXMSJXXVkb7JQbXGtw=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178446_1483497430.9224.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Dawn C Balogh is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Shana Maschak.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,315 raised of $3,000 goal"

After earning her BIS and Masters of Teaching degree she moved to Washington, D.C. and taught at the National Presbyterian School for two years and  taught first grade at McNair ES for two years. Her students and colleagues adored her.  Megan was married in 2014 to her husband, John, and they had a baby boy, in 2016. All who know Megan are touched by her generous and kind heart. Megan has a passion for teaching and when her baby boy, Bryce, entered this world Megan was the happiest mommy in the world. ""Just days after my 30th birthday, I was told I have stage 4 breast cancer. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  At the moment I received that phone call, my whole life changed. My first thought, was how is this me? I'm healthy, young and have NO history of breast cancer in my family? I have a happy, beautiful, busy, 9 month old. I am a mother. It still feels surreal.In October of 2016, I went to the doctor for a lump I thought was related to breast feeding. They told me it was a blocked milk duct. It grew and became painful.  I discovered another lump under my arm shortly after. I returned to the breast center at UVA for ultrasounds, mammograms and biopsies that confirmed I had hormone receptor positive breast cancer.I am in the 1% of women that get breast cancer in their twenties . If that isn't unusual enough, this is a rare case as it considered a pregnancy related cancer due to hormone shifts. Pregnancy related breast cancer is hard to detect and is aggressive.Following my diagnosis, I went through 5 cycles of Chemotherapy.  I got second and third opinions and went through much more testing at different hospitals. I fly out to Houston, TX to MDAnderson hospital, top  Breast cancer center in the country, for the best care. I am in good hands. This hospital has cutting edge clinical trials, endless resources and specialists who guide my treatment.I am determined to not only survive but THRIVE. I will live my life, watch my son grow, and will make a difference.I have been so inspired by the community of people that are involved with breast cancer awareness and  found ways to support others going through this journey by creating a nonprofit. Sometimes helping others is healing in itself.  I can't begin to tell you what my family and friends have meant to me especially this past year. I have felt so much love and passion and fight. That is what motivates me to dig in, believe, and be tough. With God, my family, my friends, my teaching sisters, my Ram family behind me,  I know I have the strength to fight this."" -Megan One year has passed since Megan’s journey has begun, and she has already overcome so much. The money that you graciously donate will go to providing Megan’s family with meals, nanny services for Bryce, home cleaning services, travel, and medical expenses. Megan needs your tremendous support to fight this battle. No one fights alone!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/sally-robs-recovery-fund,Sally & Rob's Apartment Fire Fund,"As many of you know, while they were on vacation over the holidays, Sally and Rob's family apartment building in Chicago experienced a fire. They were not home and are all safe but everything they own that was in their apartment has some degree of smoke and/or water damage. They are back in Chicago now and living temporarily in a hotel nearby while they deal with the fallout from this awful situation. You can read more about what happened via Sally's Facebook update that I pasted below. To cheer them up, and to help them through this tough time, we are organizing this GoFundMe drive to provide them with gift cards (Target, etc.) to replace their immediate daily needed items, and to perhaps buy them some gift cards to local Chicago restaurants/bars that they can go to and forget their worries for a time!Sally has been an invaluable leader and friend to all of us and we want to make sure she knows how loved she is!Donate as much as you'd like and I will organize getting the gift cards to her and Rob. - Allison Sally's Update: ""As Rob Muller said today to our friends, “I highly recommend if you are going to have a disaster on the home front to be looking out at a national park when it happens.” This really was so perspective getting, and also just wonderful to go onto have, even after learning of the fire, an amazing week at Zion, Bryce and Death Valley with Ben Muller Elena Muller Marion Muller.So here is the situation:- The fire started on the third floor balcony of our apartment building. Still under investigation. Only two of the families were home the morning of the fire and they and their pets all got out –the fire caused a loud explosion which, while scary, had the effect of alarming people and getting them up and out safely.- Nala was with Abby, our pet sitter, and thankfully they’d left on Christmas Eve day to go to her parents for Christmas on Chicago’s South Side. Nala then stayed all week with Abby/her family. - The top floor (third) of our apartment was badly burned (basically destroyed) by the fire, which was very hot and very fast.- Our floor (second) was primarily impacted by pretty massive smoke damage and water to some degree.- The building will need to be refurbished/rebuilt and this will take months.- We are now living at the Best Western in a small suite near our Wellington Avenue apartment (it’s actually very nice) and are looking simultaneously for a new apartment to rent and if we cannot find that quickly a furnished apartment for 2 to 3 months, hopefully in our neighborhood or Lincoln Park.- Everything in the apartment (and I mean every single thing) must be treated for smoke and -- in some cases --water damage. The apartment is sort of like a hazmat site right now – with insurance adjusters and disaster mitigation folks working hard to get everything dealt with in the next 48 hours when the walls are coming down in the building. Every item is being inventoried, and categorized as “toss” or “restore.” Then it will be trashed or packed up, sent to a warehouse to be treated for smoke mitigation, and then stored until we can reclaim it. This is a GIANT undertaking and Rob is the one there overseeing all this as I am in Bethesda as of yesterday with Marion/Nala since she (Marion) had her wisdom teeth out this morning. [She’s doing fine!]- We continue to feel unspeakably blessed that no one was hurt [or worse], and so touched by the outpouring of support and encouragement (and good advice) by friends and family far and wide. Both Rob’s colleagues at NLU and mine at UsA2 are being patient, supportive and understanding as we regain our footing; we are so grateful for that too.- I’ll do another update when we have more information about our whereabouts.- Thank you again and with so much gratitude for your support.XOXO",https://images.gofundme.com/IQHbKGiYIVgab9KX1njDOiDiWfs=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178746_1483532703.1542.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Allie Signorelli is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Sally Sachar.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$3,985 raised"

It seems that every year or sometimes every month brings a new struggle.

Her plan just 10 years ago was to be a kindergarten teacher but due to her illness, she could not complete her schooling. This same sum of money that she struggles to make, is hardly enough for living expenses and medical bills, and combined with her issues in mobility, and weaknesses, she must live at home with her mother, who also supports another child in college.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/scouts-heart-surgery,Help Save Scout-Emergency Surgery,"UPDATE 1/4/17I’m so sad to report that our sweet Scout passed away this morning.  From Scout's cousin, Teddy the Spaz Man: Aunt Cindy called UGA at 2 am to get an update but because Scout was in emergency care, they weren’t able to give her any information, other than if she didn’t receive a call, all was the same. Aunt Cindy debated and debated whether she should make the hour and a half drive to see her but decided against it, knowing the excitement from seeing her might be too much for Scout’s heart. Then Aunt Cindy got a call from UGA telling her that Scout was having an episode. They tried to resuscitate our sweet girl for 12 minutes but Scout’s heart had had enough. She was gone.Scout has had such a rough life that it’s hard to make sense why such a sweet soul would have to endure so much. But boy, Aunt Cindy sure gave her a wonderful 2 years. She took Scout for daily walks, took her and her little sidekick Ellie the Poodle to the park all the time, they went on all their vacations and Scout got LOTS of car rides, one of her favorite things to do. In fact, I’m guessing the folks at Starbucks got to know her pretty well.It was very difficult for Aunt Cindy to ask for help for Scout’s bills. When I saw what her daughter Sheena wrote this on her Instagram account - ‘MavistheAirstream’ - just now, I thought it was worth sharing as it really shows what a huge animal lover Aunt Cindy is:“45 minutes after making this post I learned Scout passed away under care at UGA animal hospital. There are no words. Asking for prayers for my parents.I feel compelled to share this story with all you animal loving folks out there. We found out yesterday that my parents beloved pup, Scout, needs a very costly emergency heart surgery. My mom is the last person to ask for help but when we all found out how unbelievably expensive this surgery was we wanted to do whatever we could to help take the burden off of her and my dad. My sister set up a gofundme page hoping for it to spread like wildfire. My aunt shared the campaign on her popular facebook page (@teddythespazman) and in just 11 hours we've raised over half of the cost of the surgery! People are just amazing. My mom is beside herself over the outpouring of love. She is the type of person that would give you her last dime and then go to the ends of the earth to get you more. She's the most selfless person I know and has helped countless homeless animals over the years and taught me compassion for all of God's creatures at its deepest level. I can't tell you how many times we've been on the side of the road or behind a fast food restaurant either feeding or trying to capture a stray. We've nursed dozens of strays back to health over the years and found them loving homes. Scout was one of these rescues. She showed up to their house like she had some kind of homing device knowing exactly where to go. She weighed just 25 lbs, was near death but absolutely elated to see us. She had a long, slow road back to health and everyone was too deep in love when it came time for her to find a home. She was already home.”REGARDING YOUR DONATIONSAunt Cindy just texted this, “We should get the final bill from UGA soon and return all the rest, assuming people want to still donate to the existing tests, care and bills and all.”Friends, I’m not sure how to do this since you obviously donated more than needed. We want to return the excess to you. We just don’t know how to do that yet or who to return it to since some would be very appreciated to help cover the existing bills. Not sure, all this happened so fast and this is new territory for us. But we will post as soon as we know more and will hopefully have that part figured out.Thank you so much for your outpouring of love, prayers and donations. You guys are simply amazing. And please continue to send prayers and healing thoughts to Aunt Cindy and her family. Thank you. <3   ORIGINAL POST 1/3/17 On October 3, 2014, a very special dog wandered into our lives. Starving, with teeth worn almost to the gums from what we presume was a do-or-die effort to free herself from whatever physical restraints held her captive, we found Scout wandering up from the woods. Despite her weakened and emaciated state, she greeted us with joyful friendliness—her tail practically wagging her body with excited relief. Over the years, we have found an abundance of homeless cats and dogs which we gladly vetted and homed, but Scout was different. She attached herself to our hearts immediately with her warmth, loyalty, courage and enduring will to survive. There would be no rehoming Scout. She was ours and we vowed to give her that forever home she so richly deserved after the valiant struggle that brought her to us. Knowing she wrapped us around her paws, she quickly made herself at home, becoming both entourage and bodyguard to our 6lb poodle, Ellie, who made it known to Scout from the beginning that she—and only she—holds the position of Alpha dog in our home. Scout, with her sweet, playful and friendly nature complies to this day. We estimate that Scout is about 7 or 8 years old. She adopted us two years ago. Last year she was bitten in the foot by a Copperhead, rushed to the closest hospital and was given anti venom. Her prognosis was 50/50. Scout once more proved to be the ever determined survivor and once again beat the odds, though it was a rough and prolonged recovery. Unfortunately, that attack is believed to be a catalyst for the problems she has been exhibiting lately.Scout has begun to collapse upon any exertion, becoming weaker and weaker with each episode. She’s been on medication for what was thought to be electrical heart issues, but after worsening to the point where she has become almost immobile—unable to take walks, play or even go potty without a heartbreaking episode, she stopped breathing twice in one day. A visit to the vet confirmed that she has two very large pulmonary blood clots that require surgery to repair. This conclusion was made after she was monitored all night and underwent several tests to make a positive diagnosis. The UGA Vet hospital is hugely optimistic that she has a good chance to live a normal life if she gets the operation she needs. At present, she is still being carefully monitored and UGA has informed us that they can do the surgery on Thursday if enough funds can be raised. Please, if you are able to help in any way, even the smallest contribution would be appreciated. Many of you know how much a beautiful creature like Scout can enrich a person’s life. Their love and loyalty is given without question, restraint or condition. Help us to save Scout. She’s been through so much. Help us give her the strength and health she needs to continue to live her life to the fullest. She’s just not ready for the Rainbow Bridge yet—and we’re not ready to let her go. Thank you.",https://images.gofundme.com/Y5GofjH6ejP9auh629Et_hNehbA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178940_1483495625.7397.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178940_1483543778.9032_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178940_1483500929.794_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178940_1483499961.0961_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178940_1483499976.7653_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17178940_1483499997.3624_funddescription.jpg']",5,"Created January 3, 2017",Calee Lutes is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$2,360 raised"

Little did we know the struggles we would encounter. Early on in our relationship I had surgery to remove a very large ovarian cyst. This caused scar tissue in my fallopian tubes. We were successful in conceiving after one and a half years. We soon found out it was ectopic and we had to terminate our pregnancy. This started the hardest emotional Rollercoaster we have been on. With the loss of our pregnancy and seeing a doctor that wasted our time and resources, we have begun to see a fertility specialist. With this our medical costs are not covered. We have spent thousands on methods that havent worked and years of effort. We will begin fertility treatments that will cost us anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 if it works the first time. Our option is IVF which is where they take my eggs and his sperm and create life outside the womb and then insert the fertilized eggs back into the womb. This will be a long and hard process as hormone injections are given and eggs have to be retrieved.  Because being parents is so strong in us we want to continue with our options. Unfortunately we cannot afford to become parents on our own. We will need assistance and possible loans to aid us in our dream. Our faith in the Lord has helped us on our journey but financially we are struggling. We would be forever grateful to anyone who would like to help us in our pursuit of parenthood. We want nothing more than to be birth parents. This journey has been emotional and has caused a lot of depression and grief but we are confident that the Lord is on our side and will guide us and continue to protect us and love us.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kennysbike,Kenny Hargrove Hand Cycle Bike,"TOP SECRET If you are receiving this it's because you know Kenny Hargrove. Kenny, as you know, is one of the most selfless people around. If you are friends with him then you skip right to the part of being in his family. Your kids are his nieces and nephews and on it goes. He's got a huge heart and is always willing to do anything for almost anyone. With all that being said Kenny has all kinds of interests and has taken on a huge interest in his own health. If you follow him on Facebook or IG, one of his single greatest joys are his work outs. I have spoken with him about getting into bike riding over the past year or even ""triathlons"".  As soon as I bring it up he goes into this ""LOOOONNG"" story about this ""one time"" he got to ride a hand cycle bike. The other night I had him over to the house and brought it up. Again he went into this long story about how much he loved ""this one time"" he got to ride this bike. I asked him why he didn't own one yet. He stated that earlier this year he had saved up about 3k dollars and unfortunately it was used for an unforeseen medical bill. Then he showed me the model he was looking at and I was floored at the cost. The base model he was looking at was around $5240 and up. But seeing how much detail is needed to get a paraplegic in one of these, I get it now. As I sat and watched him light up as he described the job of riding this bike an idea popped into my head. I thought how cool would it be if we could all get togther and surprise him with the bike. Anyway if you have recieved this it's because I know how much you mean to Kenny and vice versa. The plan would be to acummulate the money needed to purchase the bike. Then email everyone and see about getting togther once it arrives.I don't mean to exclude anyone. So if you get this and think someone else would like to chip in please share. I don't know how fast the amount needed will fill up. But I am going to do my best job of starting with his inner circle and moving out. Here is the rub.

Unfortunately all this happened a week before her medical insurance was to go into effect at the first of the year.  While some help will be applied for at the hospital, there will still be extensive costs that aren't covered and her multiple medications are needed now.  Since Melanie has spent many years taking care of others, it's our turn now to help take care of her.  Any little bit of help will be so very appreciated and lift her spirits so she can heal.",https://images.gofundme.com/P7R51cRD6MohbR8QxqBAt0C9lIQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17179280_1483496206.1971.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Paula Schuler Padgett is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Melanie Rich.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,960 raised of $15,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/lilianagarcia,Help Liliana Heal (Brain Bleed),"*While visiting my grandmother in Colombia to care for her.*       My mother, Liliana Garcia, 53 years old is the most attentive, devoted mother to me. She had been a housewife for about 10 years (until my parents divorced) and cleaned houses, other than ours, during her marriage too. (My father is a chauffeur who doesn’t make much either). When my parents divorced it hit my mother hard because it brought back memories of when her parents divorced, causing her to fall into a state of depression. We lost our home since my mom didn’t make enough cleaning due to severe back problems and arthritis so she can only push through a house a day and even then it was hard to find people who needed a house cleaner who would pay decent. (She did try to find other jobs even with the pain) We lived in motels and had our car full of luggage for some time, then we stayed in my aunts living room and eventually a small room (time span of 3 years) until disability was approved which now pays for part of our rent; I found a job to support us in other aspects, together we are a team.           On New Years, my mother suffered a heart attack that led to a brain bleed. She underwent brain surgery for four hours and then was put in an induced coma for recovery. They found her to have another brain bleed compromising more areas of the brain. That's where a 1 percent chance of survival was given and they had to check for brain death. At that point they said only a miracle would save her. I was devastated, felt anxiety and my stomach hurt so bad from crying I wanted to throw up and have the world swallow me. However, when disconnected from the ventilator my mom was able to breathe on her own meaning she is not brain dead. The brain is still sending signals, increasing my hopes, and allowing me to breathe a little lighter. The new brain bleeds are impossible to reach surgically so they disconnected her from machines to allow the body to work by itself and try to drain this extra fluid on its own. Today was the second day off the ventilator I let her listen to voice notes of my family (who unfortunately can't be with me here in Colombia) and she moved her arms, legs and yawned. All we have is prayer and I ask you to pray please if you can't donate pray for my mother because I can’t imagine a world without her. If you can donate I would appreciate it so much. As I mentioned my mother is disabled in USA due to severe back problems and arthritis that don't allow her to work because of the pain. However, the insurance does not cover the costs here in Colombia we are still trying to see if there is any way they could cover a little. She's always been sick but strong this is the third time we almost lose her but I have faith she is strong enough to make a full recovery, I need my mom.  I need monetray support becasue in Colombia they will refuse care if a large sum of money is not paid in trade. Please I, Valeria Vesga, thank you with all my heart.I just want to hold her and love her and appreciate her even more, please help me, she's my rock my happiness, my best friend. All the tough times we went through we got through because of her stength, from little she made abundance. Please pray and donate anything helps for the costs of the surgery, hospital stay, recovery, care, and airplane tickets. As my mom would say from little we can make abundance. Thank you!",https://images.gofundme.com/YMzeeTI0NmKcEXg16A46tcYX4r8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17179294_1483496868.2388.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17179294_fb_1483501607.3465_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 3, 2017",Valeria Vesga is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$6,555 raised of $50,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/beat-Joels-cancers,helping Joel beat cancer & bills,"I'm updating the main story as not everyone gets to see the updates that are posted ... the integral message of love is still here.  A story of a valuable life being threatened on mumerous levels & community support & community action having contributed to saving this life, and adding to the recovery experience.An end of July 2017 update:Greetings, Friends, Family, and all....It's now mid summer 2017. Time for an update.... The calendar shows that in a few weeks we'll be looking at the 2 year anniversary of my diagnosis. A diagnosis that included.... HCC - Hepato Celular Carcinomas, PNET's Pancreatic Neuro Endocrine Tumors, a mass forming on & near my spleen, scans also showed 3 unique kidney stones on my right side & 2 more in my left kidney, my intestines were infected with the C Difficile Virus, and along with all of this I was also suffering the pain of Pancreatitis... Treatments for the kidney stones became effective, treatment for the cancers... included a very long 12 hour surgery, followed by chemo therapies, followed by radiation therapies... we were stunned by one report which indicated aggressive growth and metastasized tumors - essentially new tumors were appearing and those that had been identified were growing. That was frightening.. lots of digging, questions, prayers & more prayers. I left work in May of '16 ... the cognitive struggle of being a professional without a profession... having to figure out how to live with out an income has been on going. Disability does not provide for much. On the technical side the last MRI report reads like this 1. Multiple hepatic metastasis are stable. (at last count there were 12 tumors nesting in various sections of my liver - some of these HCC Liver Cancer the others PNETS having come over from my Pancreas) 2. New mass medial to the spleen reflecting either a infarcted splenule or metastasis. (The oncologist says he's watching this I need not worry - yeah OK) The funds raised through this campaign have helped us beyond the ability to pay bills. Core security. Being able to demonstrate financial responsibility to the people who provide services, substances & treatments to both me & Harrison has made it easier for us to show up & be present for the treatments. It may seem so simple...when I went from being able to pay my obligation to not having the money in my account...to pay the smallest bills...fear. Insecurity, doubt, unknown....it was more complicated emotionally than I expected. Where are we now? I am taking this as good positive news and I am grateful that God has seen fit to continue with me... ...we are in mid 2017 and I can report that having received 2 MRI studies which are indicating general stability I am listening to my inner dialogue that is asking me to figure out how to test returning to work, to move ahead with life from this point... I'm feeling a bit lost and will need some help from the universe here. There are several moving pieces, my economics are fragile and that leaves little room for error. Trying to make decisions on how to live life in chunks of 90 days (outside of the One day at a Time rule); stability is a good thing. My current state of stability - I've chosen to take with a smile and attitude of gratitude. So much has changed and that leaves me with a desire to rebuild or better yet to build upon where my life is currently at....I understand that I still have cancer and that there are over a dozen tumors on my liver and a mass growing near my spleen and that sounds horrific in its own way...but I'm here and I have the spark of life in me and I want to live a good life. I don't always know exactly what that is but I'm grateful to still have however many days I'm supposed to have to work out the meaning. We are all counting days and i'm grateful that so many of us are together in this community. Love to you all. Breathing deep. I embrace all in my life. I am grateful for the opportunity to experience. To think, to feel, to live, laugh, cry, pause, pray, & move on. With love & much gratitude, Joel The original story: My name is Joel Naftelberg and I am fighting a battle with Cancer(s), beating Cancer, and pushing back trying to find a new life after Cancer has altered ever aspect of my life. From my physical health & spiritual well being to my battle with medications and addictions, through the changing landscape of being without a profession, job or income. Having to cope with the illness of my son, my own treatments for basket full of disease & illness, having to move our place of residence being forced upon us... we needed to find a new home, pack & move within the fluid madness of our daily life.Is anyone ever really prepared physically, emotionally or spiritually to fight this kind of battle? I am a cancer patient and have been put into the position of needing to ask for help.In addition to my diagnosis and beginning treatment during the summer of 2015, our family was beginning the process of coping and treating my 15-year-old son's diagnosis of Crohn's Disease. He is being treated at Morristown’s Goryeb Children's Hospital, his infusions continue every 7-8 weeks.In September of 2015 my entire existence in this life took a turn. I was diagnosed with dual cancers: Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors and HCC Hepato Celullar Cancers.  On October 30th 2015 I was waking up from twelve hours of surgery removing cancerous tumors from both my pancreas and liver.Within 45 days of my surgery, both cancers had returned to my liver. The PNETs had metastasized to my liver, rendering me unable to be listed for organ transplant. Chemotherapy started in January 2016 and continues with a daily pill regimen and monthly injections. With that comes a long list of side effects that add to the physical discomfort. Horrific radiation therapy started in October 2016; 60% of my liver was treated, the balance is on hold.One of the greatest challenges has been the uncertainty, the great unknown.It became necessary for me to leave work at the end of May 2016. Disability income covers a fraction of our expenses for living, housing, health insurance, food… the basics…add to that the costs of medical copayments and treatments. I am powerfully aware that having cancer is impactful on so much more than the body, the mind and the spirit. It is also a personal economic war on our family. I have now lost my income and ability to provide; losing our living space is within sight on the horizon or not being able feed my family is a very real possibility. It’s impossible to think about fighting cancer when I am facing this kind of worry. I’ve set up this GoFundMe as a way for all those who have graciously offered assistance, to help….family and friends have been amazing. If you can help us, please do, knowing that every day I breathe, I will be grateful. I ask that you share this in case someone else, anyone else, can help. I love my life - what it was and even what it has become. I hope to have the chance to pay it forward and will never, ever forget your gift...With continued growth of existing tumors and continued discovery of new tumors, I am looking at alternatives: meticulous diet regimens, specific supplements and organic food based treatments. I am doing my part with exercise, prayer and meditation regimens, exploring acupuncture and adding Yoga to my daily routine.I am hopeful that by March 2017 we will see evidence of radiation therapy working, if so, I will consider continuing and treat the balance of my liver with Y90 radiation in the hope that it will suppress tumor growth and, better yet, shrink what has already grown.Some days it feels like all this is happening to someone else and then I become clearly aware that all of this – the cancers, the treatments, the side effects, the economic stress – is happening to me. There are days when tying my sneaker laces is a challenge, days when I’m sad beyond belief mixed with days that I’m ever so grateful because I know and have witnessed how much worse this could be. My journey to ‘normalcy’, remission and recovery remains complicated. I am renewing my acceptance of life on life’s terms one day at a time. I am trying to accept these massive life changes with my head up, fighting hard, and trying to make my family proud and try to establish a legacy we can all be proud of. Presently my treatment is ongoing with Hackensack University Medical Center and I am asking for your help. This is one of the hardest parts; asking for help is never easy.If you've read this far, I am so appreciative and I'd like you to know something else about me....In the community service space, for the past five years I have been an organization leader for the UUCM MESH Cafe and for the past two years a member of the Board of Trustees for MESH Inc. www.meshmontclair.org Montclair Emergency Services for the Homeless (MESH) is a local, faith-based organization dedicated to engaging the Montclair community to provide basic and essential services to Montclair’s most vulnerable homeless and hungry.UUCM is a MESH partner and each week serves 60-70 homeless and hungry neighbors a nourishing meal in community, distributes clothing and health and sanitary aids.During my service the UUCM Cafe has grown from a breakfast transition with 4 or 5 volunteers to a regular meal service supported by 20-24 volunteers; local HS groups, and local businesses. We provide advocacy for & direction to some of the neediest members of our community along with educating our volunteers to the needs of neighbors and the real face of poverty, substance abuse and homelessness.I'd like to say thank you & express my gratitude. Words alone don't adequately express how filled with love & gratitude my heart is. The response to this campaign has been extremely strong... if there is ever a way that I can return the love & support that I am receiving, please know that I will.With love & gratitude,Joel",https://images.gofundme.com/oWqTjiF5oNM_SG_c3IkSXYxNqE0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17179798_1488925591.7492.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Joel Naftelberg is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$63,712 raised of $65,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/36sa2lk,Need help after son tragic accident,"We are raising money for our sister Crystal and her youngest son and our nephew Brandon.  Brandon is  5yo  who was in a tragic accident on 9/14/2017.  His clavicle artery was severed and lung were damaged. He underwent immediate emergency surgery, in which he went into cardiac arrest 4 times and lost so much blood that he needed over 20 units of blood.  It was the worst possible situation.  His outlook was grim. They were able to get him stabilized enough to have him lifeflighted to another hospital to be admitted into the  PICU.  However, before transport we were all advised he was in very critical condition. The doctors had only given him a 10 percent chance to live and weren't sure if he had sustained brain damage due to the lack of oxygen. They arrived to the PICU and  was still severely bleeding and the doctors advised that he would have to lose his left arm. Although something no one was expecting happened and  he opened his eyes.  He knew his mom. He followed the nurses instructions. So despite being down for over 20 minutes, we were thankful he woke up and knew who we were.  He held his own overnight and the following morning they took him for his second surgery  to try and save his left arm and to complete the emergency surgery he had the night before.   He did great through his surgery and were able to save his arm, by removing a part of his carotid artery in his leg. The doctors are not sure if he will ever be able to move it and it would take a year for them to actually know for sure.  As of today 9/16/17.  He is still in stable condition.  He was feeling agitated this morning but was able to stick out his tongue when asked by the nurses. Also, he calmed down by hearing his mom.  They have to keep an eye on his chest and can't rule out that he won't need another surgery, and will need another surgery on his arm.  So we are hoping to raise money to help raise money to help Crystal with medical costs, being out of work, and having to commute to the hospital from home. She also has an older son that needs her as well.   So if there is anything you can do to help this little family every little bit  counts.  It  would be greatly appreciated by her. I know she is just happy to still have her little boy but we would love to see anything that would be able to help her with this burden.

Jon was only 46 yrs old and was one of the kindest, warmest men you would ever be lucky enough to know. It is so fitting that his beautiful family, that he loved so dearly, has made the ultimate gift of organ donation. Jon has already been matched with four people who will now live because of him. The donation specialists are working on additional matches and they tell us he may eventually live on in 25+ people. It is so, so poignant and fitting as Jon would literally give you the shirt off his back. When he went to sleep last night, he could not have known how many lives he would touch today. But I know that nothing would make him happier. Jon leaves behind his beautiful wife Holly and his three sons, JT, Nate and Eli. You have never known a man that was prouder of his family. This photo was taken just three days ago as Jon rang in New Years Eve with his wife and his boys.  They could not know what lay before them as they laughed and celebrated together.  But in that moment, it didn't matter -- the future was not yet written and in that moment, they were together.  Please pray for them and for the rest of our family as we say goodbye to this beautiful man that we loved so much. Godspeed, Jon. It was my honor to know you and call you brother. As for this GoFundMe page, a friend suggested that I set it up to help Holly and the boys with the future.  I have no idea of what the medical costs will be but with emergency brain surgery followed by life support, I have to assume it will be astronomical.   if you are inclined to make a donation, it would be appreciated.  If you would prefer to offer a kind thought, a prayer or other intention on the family's behalf, that would also be greatly appreciated.  If I could ask for two more things...one, tell people that you love them every chance you get and two, consider becoming an organ donor.  Thank you all.",https://images.gofundme.com/19rhOp7RaYM7qyvpivhKwqh8cRg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17179962_1483497726.9286.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Ciara Greene Fournier is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Holly Fournier.,Funerals & Memorials,"$15,295 raised of $150,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/paralysis-rehabilitation-for-maddy,Paralysis Rehabilitation for Maddy,"My name is Roger Rouse  and I am the father of Madison  (Maddy) Rouse. Since 2014 my daughter Madison, pictured above,  has suffered from chronic lower back and kidney pain and has been in and out of the Seattle Children’s Hospital while doctors tried to determine what was wrong. The doctors finally decided that it would be best, after three years of no solid progress, to just ablate the nerves to her kidneys to stop the pain. On December 19, 2016 Madison underwent surgery to have a renal nerve ablated. Madison’s insurance company refused to allow her to have the surgery at the University of Washington Center for Pain where she has been going for years, and where the doctors were familiar with her case, but insisted she do the surgery in Kalispell, Montana.        On December 20, 2016, within 24 hours of her nerve ablation, and just five days before Christmas, she was paralyzed from the waist down. After the surgery she had a spinal stroke as a blood clot entered her spine and blocked blood from flowing to her spinal cord. The doctors in Kalispell did not know where the pain was coming from and it was not until 12 hours later the doctors found the cause of her pain and began to treat her, but it was too late, the damage had been done to her spinal cord. She has some slight feeling but no movement from just above her waist downward.         After years of pain Madison was on the doorstep of living a semi-pain free life, but now she is paralyzed and unable to walk. We are all devastated at this turn of events and want Madison to have the best possible rehabilitation and chance at a good life.  Madison’s insurance is refusing to allow her to receive rehabilitation treatment at Craig Hospital in Colorado. Craig Hospital, known as one of the best spinal and brain injury hospitals in the USA, has helped thousands to have better lives and there is hope that Madison getting her rehabilitation there could help her regain some movement. Both her mother and I are not financially well off,  so we cannot afford the full costs of rehabilitation treatment at Craig Hospital. We are asking for financial help to provide Madison with at least her initial rehabilitation at Craig hospital (45 days), so that she gets the best possible start to adjust to her new life, and regain some confidence, and hope for her future.       We would like to be able to get her immediately into Craig Hospital since it has only been a few weeks since the injury to her spinal cord and the sooner she gets very good treatment the better it will be for her.      It is very hard for me to ask for handouts but when I see what has become of my daughter all my pride vanishes. Please help us reach our goal of $99,000.00 US dollars, which is the cost of treatment for 45 days at Craig hospital.    Our gratitude at your generosity, kindness and help is immeasurable.",https://images.gofundme.com/vc-QzuVNJPDb_Gw1yzuJmW0iueM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17180386_1483507037.477.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Roger Rouse is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Keley Rouse.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,615 raised of $99,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/8dollarsquishychallenge,The $8 Squishy Challenge!,"In 2011, Paw Prints Private Rescue began as a small all breeds cat and dog rescue group in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Squishies Flat Faced Cat Rescue was founded in 2012, to give flat faced cats all the special care they need and to find them homes that understand the commitment they require. After 4 years of running Paw Prints and Squishies Cat Rescue side by side, we have now merged the two groups creating Squishies Flat Faced Animal Rescue Incorporated. As a result of the hundreds and hundreds of animals we have taken in over the past 7 years, we have an outstanding vet bill at Maroondah Vet Clinic of over $28,000.  As hard as we try to reduce this enormous bill, with animals still coming into care, we just cannot find the money to continue to save lives and pay off the debts of the hundreds of animals that are now living happily ever after in their forever homes. (www.petrescue.com.au/groups/10033?listings=rehomed) In addition to this, Squishies Headquarters, which is the nerve centre of the rescue and also houses our perma-squishies and the bulk of animals in care at any time; is relocating. This is a huge financial drain on our founder, who is personally covering all relocation costs for the rescue, reducing the amount of money she has to put into the costs of running the rescue, feeding the animals and paying the vet bills. We are asking that you please consider making a donation towards our outstanding vet bill, to allow us to continue to rescue, without having to think about how much an animal will add to our massive vet bill, before deciding if we can take them on. If each of our Squishies Facebook followers donated just $8, our bill would be gone! Can you imagine that?! A fresh start for the vet bill would allow us to expand the rescue and help even more Squishies in need. Have you had $8 worth of enjoyment from seeing our posts and following the journeys of our Squishies?! Literally all it will take is just $8 each. This would also mean that we could spend more time posting photos, updates and videos, because we wouldn’t have to spend the little spare time we can find, fundraising for the outstanding bill!  More rescued Squishies, more photos and updates of rescued Squishies and a clean slate on the vet bill, so we don’t have to think about costs when asked to help a Squishy in need.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/navarre-family-medical-expenses,Navarre family medical expenses,"First, and foremost. We hope everyone had a good Christmas, and New Year! Unfortunately, not all of us started 2017 off with a bang. I, most definitely understand that many other humans on this planet have life more difficult and go through things much harder than what my family is about to experience. Our parents, Theresa and Michael Navarre are givers. They are the most giving people we know. Heck, I'm not just saying that because they are our parents, but I'm saying that because it's the honest to god truth. They've given to other families, children, and random people as much as they give to their own family. For years, our parents have cared for children who weren't theirs, they have bent over backwards to make sure other people can house their families, they have borrowed and lended money to people, all-the-while never expecting anything in return. I have witnessed with my own eyes, the many times my dad just lends. They literally never stop giving. When, in all reality I wish they would take care of them. Both our parents are always very sick. It started with our dad, having back surgery. Then he had his pancreas fail, was in a coma and had to go through dialysis in Detroit to overcome what happened to him. The only income our family currently has is disability. Our parents don't live beyond their means at all. They have enough money just for house bills. Not including, all their medical bills that are adding up. Our mother, Theresa, is also facing some horrible news. About 7 years ago she lost her Spleen. It's still in her body, but barely surviving. She is on blood thinners because her body doesn't produce a very good blood flow. Many of her arteries are blocked. As most people know, our mom is a very hardworking, busy, loving person. She never sits still, and is always looking for something to do or clean, because she can't work. About 1 1/2 months ago our mom had reconstructive surgery in her leg to try and unclog some arteries so she could experience warmth and the sense of touch in her legs and feet. The surgery didn't work. During the holidays our mom was in excruciating pain, and tears. She couldn't feel a pulse in her leg where her doctor whom performed the reconstruction told her she should be able to feel one. On Monday, January 2nd 2017 at about 6 A.M. our dad took our mom back to the hospital. They received the news that the surgery was not successful and that she would have to have her leg amputated. That's definitely no news a family wants to hear. As we all understand many people have it much worse, it's a very difficult time for our parents and with all the medical bills and our mom needing prosthetics, a little bit from the people would be very much appreciated. The equipment is what we're trying to cover, as her insurance will cover most the surgery just not the actual prosthetic calf leg and foot. Whatever anyone can help with, our family would be forever grateful and continue to be as giving as all of you as well.",https://images.gofundme.com/dmRXc-3v7JO-WRl7NbxGcJhP0W4=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17180426_1483499166.5617.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Ashley Groh is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Michael Navarre.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,705 raised of $5,000 goal"

It will be a chance to be the hands and feet of Jesus to a community that needs to see what that looks like. I will be going with a team of wonderful people, some who have been before and some that are new, all while working alongside them to create a fun and exciting chance to run a sports camp. We will be gone for 9 days starting on July 6th. While we are over there we will be working inside the community of Chennai to work through sports and building a community of love and support for each other. This includes serving the poor, rebuilding the community and finding ways to share Christ's love. As the trip is for almost ten days, the cost is great. I need to raise $3800 by July. $2000 of that is needed by May 1st to ensure flights. Please prayerfully considered donating financially for my trip, but more importantly pray for the people I will come in contact with, my team as we travel and my family as they stay home.

This is MY family. I was lucky enough to meet Jennifer 13 years ago and we were fast friends. I met her family not long after that and spent some unforgettable moments with them. I think Bradley has at one point or another worked on every car I have owned. He is a very talented mechanic. He has always been there for me whenever I need him. That is how the Huett's are. They are the most loving, caring, loving and generous people I know. It is my turn to return the favor. It is with tears I write this. PLEASE help me relieve their financial burden of battling Stage 4 cancer;  medical bills, his inability to work, insurance costs, chemo and radiation treatments and much more Let's help make things a little easier on them. Read their story told by Jenn, Bradley's wife and do anything you can. PRAY for them! Bradley will beat this! I know it. He has to. Let's HELP this family!!!'In June of this summer Brad started complaining of pain in his knee. Over the next few months it became progressively worse. During this time he had seen several doctors that told him nothing was wrong with his knee. Finally he was referred to a rheumatologist that eventually did an MRI. At this point he was unable to walk. There was an abnormality in the joint of his knee and it was leaking bone marrow.  He was then referred to an orthopedic oncologist who did a biopsy and he was told it was cancer on September 1st. That same oncologist said that it was not the primary tumor and then referred him to another oncologist that did a PET scan to determine that it was Stage 4 Lung Cancer. He has been unable to work since June. Bradley is a Marine and in the midst of all of this has found out that while he was stationed at Camp Lejeune twice during his military service they had contaminated drinking water that has caused multiple diseases, including lung cancer. He also lived there as a child when his father was in the service.  He immediately started radiation in September on the knee and lung to try to get him out of pain and is now undergoing chemo until mid-February. He also does physical therapy twice a week to try to get him walking again so that he can go back to work.

I sit here and write this tonight as my family and I just came home from Sick Kids  Hospital visiting friends that are very close to us. I recevied a call two days ago from my friend to let me know his son was hospitalized and because they had some abnormal test results come back they were transfering him to Sick Kids. Today they were told the one thing that no parent would ever want to hear, your child has cancer.  I can not even imagine what this would feel like.  So  I would now like to address them by name. My friend Jamie is Cole's father,  Ashley Cole's mother, and  Cole. Cole was born 10 years ago with Down Syndrome and he is an amazing kid.  Cole has endured and overcome so many obstacles in his short life. Cole has been a great friend to my oldest daughter. My wife and I have been friends with Ashley and Jamie for 12 years. They have devoted their whole lives to raising Cole. They have annual charity garage sales and give all the money to Sick Kids Hospital.  Ashley and Jamie devote alot of their time to help further Down Syndrome awarness and are Cole's biggest advocates.  Now Cole is going to start a treatment process that is going to take months. We are hoping to raise between 6 to 8,000.00 dollars which all funds recieved will go directly to the family to help cover daily cost of living, (home bills, food, parking at the hospital, and gas money, etc) so Cole's mom, Ashley can stay by his side 24/7 and Jamie, Cole's dad will also be moving into the hospital but he will be returning to work in a couple of days. We are starting this page for them to help them make ends meet as they don't have any work benfits. They are down one income and are likely going suffer with just one coming in. Jamie will likely be on reduced hours with Cole's upcoming surgeries and treatment schedules.  These are amazing parents and great friends that need our help. We donated last year to a family on this site in a simaler situaion, so it gave us the idea tonight to start this fundraiser. My wife and I will be starting the fundraiser with a $200 dollar donation. No parent should have the added stress of thier financial wellbeing in such a time as this. Please help this family in anyway you can, no donation is to small. We will update the page on Cole's condition as we get information.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/y3-bretts-medical-fund,Brett's Medical Fund,"Seventeen years ago, Sara Motsay and Brett Cohen met for the first time (or at least the first time that mattered). Shortly thereafter, Brett knew that Sara was the one for him, but being the stubborn person Sara is, it took her a few years to see the light. While on a trip to Vegas in July 2002, Sara finally realized what Brett already knew - that they loved each other and there was no one else she would want to spend her life with. In December the same year, the pair were engaged and on March 23, 2003 the two were married. For almost 14 years, the two have been happily married to the love of their life, and best friend!Unfortunately, not all is bright in the City of Lights. In November 2016, Brett began getting very sick. After weeks of fighting red tape to get doctors' appointments, tests run, and answers, Sara and Brett learned that Brett had more concerns than just gallstones. In the week before Christmas, thirty-six year old Brett was diagnosed with colon cancer and told that it had spread to his liver. Barely into the New Year, Brett and Sara were presented with even worse news when they were told that Brett's cancer was at Stage 4, and told that he was estimated as having only a few more years.As a musician, being sick makes it (very) difficult for Brett to continue working, making Sara and Brett live off of only the one income. With the added expense of cancer bills, this is only cause for more stress when the pair should be focusing their energy on helping Brett be better. This fund is to help the Cohens with the medical bills they are already accumulating and will only continue to grow in the months and years to come. If you aren't in a position to donate financially, please donate with your well wishes and thoughts. If you are religious, please keep Brett in your prayers. Please send Brett and Sara as many positive thoughts as you can for Brett's health, strength, and recovery. It's been said a million times before, but it still rings true - every little bit helps.We want Brett to beat the estimation the doctors gave him. We want Brett and Sara to have many, many more happy years together. We want Brett to have many more visits to see Chewbacca. But most of all, we want to help this wonderful couple be able to not worry so much on how they will pay the medical expenses so they can focus on what's really important - Brett's health.",https://images.gofundme.com/WlyKHVZ_IT40UsruCZmoVXLtU-U=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17181008_1483500870.1946.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Sara Motsay Cohen is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Brett & Sara Cohen.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$8,646 raised of $15,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/rehabforD,Rehabilitation Program for My Mom,"My name is Ashley and my mother is an alcoholic.  The above photograph was taken of her and I on my wedding day. It was 6.30.12 and it was one of the happiest days of my life. I got to marry my best friend surrounded by dear friends and family. It made it extra special having my mom there to celebrate . . . something I never could let myself believe would happen until it did due to her history of addictions. In this photo, she had been sober for roughly 5 years. On 12.21.16 my mom called me and confessed that she had started drinking about a week after this photo was taken. She shared that she was miserable and ready to get better. Without anyone asking her to, she had contacted a rehabilitation program. We booked her flight that night and the following morning she flew from Bakersfield to Sacramento to begin detox and a 28-day rehabilitation program at Cedar Crest. Five days later she received devastating news that her insurance would not cover her treatment. She could not afford to pay out of pocket for treatment so she took a train home on the evening of 12.27.16 feeling defeated and lost. The next morning she woke up and began slipping back into her old patterns. She knew she couldn't be home and continue her sobriety after only 5 days of treatment so she contacted another rehabilitation program. I helped by speaking to the In-Take Coordinator and was assured that insurance would cover the new rehabilitation program. The facility is called Capo by the Sea and is located in San Juan Capistrano. We were told that all my mom would be responsible to pay was $2,000. My mom was able to pay $1,000 up front but that was all she could afford. She asked for my help with the promise of paying me back. However, I do not want her to pay me back. All I want is for her to be healthy and happy. I do not want her to be a slave to her addictions anymore. Upon agreeing to pay the remaining $1,000 as a gift the In-Take Coordinator bought her a flight from Bakersfield to Orange County. She began treatment at the new facility on 12.31.16. The timing couldn't have been better . . . she was getting a second chance on the eve of a new year.  Today, 1.2.17, I received a call from her. She was crying and explained that she was just told her insurance changed from a PPO to HMO on 1.1.17. The rehab was covered by the PPO but the facility does not accept HMO insurance. Our worst nightmare has happened yet again. Right now, we are feeling frustrated and helpless. How did the insurance not communicate this? Why did the new facility not investigate this more?? How is this happening?? The treatment program costs roughly $29,000 out of pocket but the facility is willing to work with my mom. If she can pay an additional $6,500 on top of the original $2,000 they will let her stay for the 28-day program. I am extremely proud of my mom for making the decision to stop drinking all on her own. It saddens me to think that she will not get to complete the program because of insurance. If you feel led to donate to my mother's rehab it would mean the world to her and I. No amount is too little. Your prayers are also greatly appreciated. I struggled writing and sharing this because it’s intimidating to share personal business to casual acquaintances, let alone strangers. However, with my mom’s blessing, I am trusting that it will be received and shared with grace. If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction, depression, or mental illness please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Everyone has a story and is struggling in some way. Silence does not bear fruit. We can help to support and empower one another.",https://images.gofundme.com/AsX4p4qNnTRBHjZsoXJaLmIhb9A=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17181032_1483500846.4261.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Ashley Southworth is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$4,199 raised of $4,199 goal"

Holley is a 31-year-old Texas native who grew up in Melissa and graduated from Texas A&M University. Holley and I met during graduate school at the same time I met her husband, Scott, who was also in the graduate program at Texas A&M. Since graduation, we’ve remained close; sharing experiences such as marriages and more recently, having children. Holley and Scott have a 2-year old (Brady) and a 5-month old (Levi). As you read more about Holley’s condition, it’s important to note how devastating this has been for her family seeing that she has two little boys that rely greatly on her well-being.On November 1st, 2016, Holley received a flu vaccination. Five days later, her toes started tingling and her hands became numb. Holley knew something was wrong and went to the hospital.  She was admitted and diagnosed with Guillian-Barre' Syndrome (GBS).  GBS is an autoimmune syndrome that attacks the peripheral nervous system. Soon after the diagnosis, she started IVIG treatments, but Holley did not respond to the eight treatments and her condition quickly progressed.  Over a period of five days she lost movement in most of her body including legs, arms, breathing muscles, and face.  A week after being admitted to the hospital, Holley was sedated, had a tracheotomy, and was put on a ventilator.  Two weeks after receiving a flu shot this mother of two went from taking her kids Trick-or-Treating on Halloween to being paralyzed and fighting for her life. Then a day after Thanksgiving, Holley’s lung muscles weakened and she had acute respiratory failure.  Holley’s heartrate and blood pressure increased, her pH was acidic, and her carbon dioxide levels were extremely high.  Because of the quickness and severity of the failure, Holley had to be moved to a different hospital that could offer her advanced treatment options. The doctors determined an ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) unit was needed which is considered total life support. Our prayers were answered by Dr. Schwartz, numerous nurses/staff and angels when Holley came off the ECMO a few days later. Since the ECMO, her respiratory recovery has been gradual and she was moved from ICU to a long term acute care facility. Although Holley is on her long road to recovery, she continues to battle limited movement in her hands and legs, nerve pain, infections, increased heartrate, muscle spasms, difficulty breathing, and elevated carbon dioxide levels.The doctors will not release Holley to a rehab facility until she is completely off ventilator assistance.  At the beginning of January the doctors are starting to wean Holley off the ventilator.  If everything works out, Holley could have the trach removed in two weeks and be one step closer to rehab and regaining mobility in her legs and arms. Up until Christmas Day, Holley had not been able to see her little boys since she was first admitted to the hospital early November. As someone with two little children roughly the same ages as Holley’s, I cannot fathom not seeing my babies for almost two months. Throughout this entire journey, Scott has been managing the day-to-day caretaking and logistics of their children. The last couple of months have been an emotional rollercoaster for Holley and her family but fortunately, Holley is headed in the right direction for recovery. Holley will have months of therapy to regain her walking ability and other day-to-day tasks.  I have started this GoFundMe page because I know Holley and Scott’s medical bills and related costs are piling up. After all they have been through, and are still going through, I am saddened by the thought of them having to worry about the financial burden as a result of this medical devastation. So I ask you, please help my friends. Every little bit helps towards Holley’s fight. And above all else, please keep praying for Holley and her family.

While snorkeling, my mom suddenly felt a little dizzy, weak, & short of breath. After much CPR, a ride in the ambulance, & a long wait in a tiny room, we were informed that they did everything they could, ""however,"" she did not respond & did not breathe or have a pulse. That word ""however"" will never have the same meaning to me.We are not exactly sure as to what happened as the autopsy will be done later this week. It all went so fast. I am still trying to process it. But, no matter how it happened, we know that she is in a better place today. She is with our Savior Jesus. She is in a happier, safer, better home. ""Death is shocking to the system no matter who it is, how old they are, or how expected it is, but to lose a loved one unexpectedly while vacationing with family is uncomprehendible. Ashley and her husband John were unable to be with her family in the Bahamas. Ashley went about her normal day when she received the worst news you could imagine. She shared this on her Facebook page today and it really puts into persepctive how precious life is. ""Today I lost my best friend, my mom, my rock, my everything. We don't know how or why. She was in the Bahamas with the rest of my family. I will miss her terribly. She made everything good.

The spirit Michelle had while at the ball fields is how we all have the priviledge to remember her as. Michelle was such a wonderful, caring, fun and welcoming spirit at all the softball games. The support the Goettl family not only showed for eachother, but for the other players was remarkable. Support is what this wonderful family needs most during this very tough time and what better way than helping relieve some financial burden. Currently they are dealing with the autopsy and the cost of getting Michelle's body back to Minnesota.

Our parents are music teachers, so we have been surrounded by music for our entire life. Throughout middle and high school we have earned seats in various honor bands at the regional and all-state level. In a culmination of our hard work we won the spots in the top orchestra, Youth Symphony through a competitve audition process. I joined Youth Symphony Fall of 2015 and Ben joined the following year. In 2014, Youth Symphony tied for first place in an international competition called Summa Cum Laude. This summer, Youth Symphony is touring Hungary and Austria for the same international competition. We will be playing in world-renowned concert halls such as the Musikviernen where the Vienna Philharmonic regularly performs.Unfortunately, this incredible opportunity comes attached with a hefty price tag- $4400 each. We need all the financial help we can get from now until July 1st to be able to go to Hungary and Austria. With our orchestra, we have prepared for months with one of the leading conductors in the country (Mr. Jeffrey Grogan) and numerous coaches from prestigious ensembles such as the New York Philharmonic. With these people, we have learned and prepared professional-level repertoire such as Bernstein's Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, and Stravinsky's Firebird. All our preparation culminates in this performance-filled two week trip to Europe. Support from people like you would mean that Ben and I are able to play in some of the world's finest concert halls, spend almost two weeks in Europe with some of our best friends, and share some incredible memories together before I go off to college next year.

These  are just a few words to describe my beautiful mom.  If you have been lucky to have met my mom you will most likely say the same, and even add more kind words to the list of amazing things that make my mom literally an angel on earth. Unfortunately, several months ago our family received news that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Being that our grandmother passed away at a very early age from the same awful disease my mother made the decision to have a double mastectomy.    Call it naive or wishful thinking, but we had hoped that by doing a double mastectomy she would be able to remove all the cancer and be cancer free with no need of chemo or radiation. Well sadly that wasn't the case and the cancer spread to a lymph node in her left armpit. This completely caught us all off guard and now we are scrambling to try and figure out what we can do to help heal and save Mamaria. Well, what now? Chemo, radiation, or no chemo or radiation and only natural interventions??? There is so much to decide and the pressure is on to hopefully make the right decision. The options are difficult, confusing , scary, overwhelming, and very very costly.    Decidedly, it feels that all our decisions are being forced by financial availability. And the options aren't that great.  Insurance will only cover so much or not so much. Chemo, radiation, is the only thing insurance will cover and anything outside of that is up to us.So with all that being said, my mom  has decided to start chemo with the hopes of also being able to try and save/build up her immune system with Naturalpath treatment. The money will help cover some of the medical out of pocket, deductibles, copays, allow her to be treated at a Naturalpath facility, help support her and my father as she is no longer the second form of income, and ultimately be stress free allowing her to only focus on her journey of healing. I honestly don't know what else to say but HELP! Please HELP! If you have anything to donate please please do, and if not please at least add my mother to your prayers  and truly with all your heart and soul ask god to save my mom. My family, and  our friends, need more blissful years on this planet with Mamaria. She needs to see her grandbabies grow and be able to tell her with their own words, ""what an amazing woman she is"", and see with their own eyes how blessed we all are to have her as our family angel and our rock!

If not, let me tell you why you would. Kelly is commonly known as Patti's ""hot rock guy."" He runs a small business, Big Red Custom Rocks where he has traveled the region selling rocks and making friends with other vendors and customers at festivals, craft shows and trade shows. He works very hard, but he plays hard as well. Kelly loves Vegas Bombs, going out to eat and dancing. There is nothing he loves more, however; than his family and friends. Whether he's traveling for work, or stopping by the grocery store, he always brings back gifts for his favorite people. Patti is a special needs preschool teacher, a passion she pursued as an adult. She puts her heart and soul into working with children. Her face lights up when she tells stories about work, and her students' faces light up when she runs into them out in the real world. Patti also loves to play hard - dancing the night away with Kelly whenever possible. Another love they share, their family and friends. Patti has put others before her for her entire life.Kelly and Patti are two of the most loving and caring people on this planet. They would give a stranger the shirt off their back and sacrifice anything to help out their family and friends. They would never ask anyone for help, which is why I'm going to do it for them.Both Kelly and Patti have struggled with health issues for years:In 2013, Patti was diagnosed with Scleroderma, a rare and chronic disease that hardens the skin, connective tissues and organs. Some days are better than others, but regardless Patti remains positive, optimistic and always on the move to do things for others.Kelly has suffered from diabetes for years. Two years ago he underwent a quintuple bypass. He suffered a stroke this past summer, and a second this fall, which left him unable to swallow or walk on his own. He also overcame internal bleeding that doctors still do not know the cause of. He spent more than a month at the Madonna Rehabilitation Center in West Omaha. Kelly made tremendous progress, being able to eat by Thanksgiving and walk with a walker  shortly after. Kelly's determination has been incredibly inspiring.On December 31, Kelly was admitted into the ICU for pneumonia. Neither of them really thought much of this, as Kelly gets diagnosed with walking pneumonia every year. Things took a turn on Sunday, January 1st when Kelly went into cardiac arrest. It took them about 20 minutes to get his heartbeat regulated. Since then, he has been on a ventilator and having kidney issues as well as fluid in his longs and internal bleeding. Monday night he began to have seizures.Right now we are living hour-to-hour, minute-by-minute. We are awaiting test results and an MRI in the morning.We thank you so much for all the texts, phone calls, positive thoughts and prayers. Your love and support mean more to us all than words could ever express. Many people have reached out to see how they could help - something other than prayers. And although Kelly and Patti would never ask for anything from any of you, we wanted to give people an outlet to help with the financial burdens that lie ahead, including medical bills. Thank you so much for helping out these two very special people with however you are able.PS - We promise to keep everyone updated with Kelly's status the best that we can.

On October 24th Pat was diagnosed with Acute myeloid leukemia (a fast moving form of leukemia) after rigorous testing. Then finding out this heartbreaking news the family was determined it would be treatable. A specialist preformed a bone marrow test which was then sent to an Oncologist in Prince George and Vancouver. Pat and Brenda (Pat's wife), were told on October 27th that this form was not treatable by the doctor. The tests determined it was terminal and deamed untreatable. Pat was given three to six months to live. Within the first month of knowing his white blood cells decreased tremendously which left his immune system depleted, leaving him highly vulnerable to infections. He started using natural immunity boosters which on his next blood tests appeared to sustain his white blood cell count. Pat and Brenda were informed of the CIPAG Clinic and of Dr. Castillo in Tijuana Mexico. Following up on this clinic via web, they began emailing back and forth with the clinic. They decided to follow through. Within a week (shortly before christmas) after emails and phone calls they set a cosultation date for January 3rd 2017. The family found comfort and hope with this decision. What a great Christmas gift! On January 1st 2017 they flew out of Grande Prairie AB with great anticipation on their way to Tijuana. January 3rd 2017: After meeting with the doctor for two hours they immediatley started treatment and accepted him into their 25 day program.  We will continue to post further updates !On the families behalf, we thank you for all donations as every dollar counts to help them through this difficult time. Sincerly, Adrianna Anderson (Grandaughter)Costs:Treatment: $9,000 USDRoom: $138 USD per night (Approximately one month) $4,278 USDShuttle: Included in roomFood:  breakfast included in room, Approximately $75 USD per day $2,325 USDAirfare: Approximately $1505.29 USD Approximate Estimation: $ 22730.54 CAD",https://images.gofundme.com/Vqa0QnVq5eV9hkTwVPXE7RLZXUE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17182296_1483585387.7084.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Adrianna Shawn Anderson is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$7,725 raised of $9,600 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/aparalympicathletesdream,A Paralympic Athlete's Dream,"Background: My name is Will Hamilton, I'm 21, and I have a rare disability called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Type III) (also known as Brittle Bone Disease). As a result of my disability, I have had to undergo many surgeries to straighten my bones and have suffered several dozen broken bones during my childhood and most of my adolescence. My arms have broken roughly five times on each arm from little to no strain or reason. As a result of this, it has hindered my overall range of motion and strength.Past, Present, and Future: I first started to pick up Track and Field in the Spring of 2014, not knowing anything about the sport or even what a racing chair was. I still remember going into the chair fitting day, seeing one for the first time and hopping into it. I immediately loved it. I just knew this was the sport for me. Even when I was a kid, I loved going fast and going down hills in my neighborhood. I was always told not to because everyone was afraid that I would get hurt but I didn't care. No one was going to stop me, and luckily, I never ended up getting hurt by flying down those hills. Skipping ahead to my first track practice--I just couldn't stop smiling. I would go around the track and just feel this extreme amount of freedom. You could almost say, happiness in it's purest form. About a week after that on my second practice, it ended up taking a toll on my body and I suffered a broken shoulder blade. This is purely what motivated me to continue the sport. I was tired of being so physically weak and tired of feeling like I had to worry about getting hurt every time I tried a new sport. I started training immediately after I healed from that break and that brings me to where I am now. I am at the strongest point I have ever been in my life and it has been over three years since my last broken bone (not counting the shoulder blade). Training has paid off immensely, not only for racing, but it has allowed me to go through everyday life a little easier. Right now, my current goal is to qualify for the national track event this summer in July and my dream is to become an athlete for the U.S. Paralympic Team in the future. Unfortunately, it has always been a struggle to gather funds to purchase equipment. When I purchased my own chair and all of the additional parts (frame, wheels, indoor roller, straps, footplate, speedometer, gloves, etc.) in 2015, it costed nearly $3500. Right now, I cannot pay for a new set of wheels myself. I do not have a backup set of wheels and I cannot pay for any repairs if there was damage to my chair and/or buying new equipment for it. A set of the best quality racing wheels are very expensive (roughly $2000 for a set), however, they would improve my chair’s durability, allow me to have a spare set (in case anything goes wrong), and help me improve as an athlete. Ideally, I would like to purchase these before I compete to qualify for the event this summer.Shoutouts: Before I end, there are many people that I would like to thank for helping me on my journey so far. A lot of the reasons why I have been able to make as much progress as I have are because of the people who believe in me and understand that this is something that I love doing. All of my friends, family, teachers, coaches, and my community give me these opportunities to train and have made sacrifices to help me become the person I am today, whether that be making time during my school day to help promote physical health, practices and meets that allow me to learn and compete with other racers, distances that my family transport me just so I can get in some training whenever I need to, and even people who I don't know that stop and take their time to encourage me. I made promises to a lot of these people that I would continue to pursue my dream, even if I face setbacks or discouragement. As someone who is very competitive and takes great pride in my sport, this is something I will fulfill. I would not be as far as I am today without all of the support I have received from all of them day in and day out. I truly cannot express how thankful I am for everything you all do for me. Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read my story. By reaching my goal, I plan to keep you all updated on my progress over time and show the world that you can achieve your dreams if you want it bad enough. If possible, any donations would be very appreciated. More importantly, please share this with anyone who would find this story uplifting and empowering.""The only limitations are the ones we create.""",https://images.gofundme.com/960uUPe4FKo6HD3t9tJp-_FOqq8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17182304_1483504429.8105.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17182304_1483505065.7207_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 3, 2017",Will Hamilton is organizing this fundraiser.,"Sports, Teams & Clubs","$1,670 raised of $2,500 goal"

The Strength of Tim. The Resilience of Beth. The Love within and around them. It’s difficult to look at the Ingram’s struggle and realize that there is not much that we can do. You’re right, there is not much we can do outside of offering comfort, love, and prayer. How often have we looked up and wished for some way to help. That’s why this GoFundMe page was created.  For those of us who love Beth and Tim Ingram, this is our opportunity to help.  A way to help in a very meaningful and impactful way. The Ingram's and those around them have not only been pushed to the limits of love, strength, and resilience, but also to the limits of finance. Modern medicine can be a miracle, however that miracle comes at a cost. Often times at a cost that is almost unfeasible.  We can take the burden of cost away from the Ingram's. We can give them one less thing to worry about. We can allow them to focus on what’s important right now; Strength, Love, and Resilience.Cole (8 months) & Dean (3)Background Beth Ingram, 34, was diagnosed with soft tissue Sarcoma cancer in January 2016 while pregnant with her second son.  It originated with a large fist sized tumor in her hip area, which was removed.  The cancer has spread to her lungs, which is inoperable.  She endured chemo treatments while pregnant as well as after the baby was born. In November 2016 a scan showed the Sarcoma was back in her hip & the spots on her lungs are bigger & have multiplied. Beth went to the hospital  on Christmas Eve for severe pain then again on New Years Eve when two tumors were discovered in her brain. The brain tumors were successfully removed & two days after being home recovering she was admitted again for pain.  A large tumor was found in her abdomen.  Beth is still in the hospital & has started another round of chemo to shrink the tumors. She is very weak, in a lot of pain and on oxygen.  We are all praying she can get home as soon as possible to be with Tim and take care of her two precious boys.Update Feb 2017 - Our dear friend, cousin, niece, wife, daughter, sister and mother Beth has moved on to watch over us all from above. In doing so she is trusting us to care for the loved ones she leaves behind. We wont let her down. Friends and Family, The outpouring of support has been nothing short of incredible. Such a selfless act shown by so many to ease the suffering of this wonderful family. It is apparent that love and compassion are alive and well within our shared social circles. I realize that people willing to give so fully and unselfishly are likely the type of people who require no thanks. However, your going to get one. Thank you so dearly for your contribution. This money is such an incredible blessing. Though it may not ease the heartache, it can ease other things. We can ease day to day life. We can ease medical bills. We can ease the effort that must be directed towards things other than healing. So in that way perhaps we can indirectly ease the heartache.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/juliesteeth,Help Fix Julie's Teeth,"Hi guys, I'm Chris and this is for my wife Julie. Most of you know her to be a fun, loving, awesome mother/wife, and all around amazing woman. She is definitely all of that, but she has had it pretty rough when it comes to her teeth. You would never know it judging by her pictures ever or hear her complain about them to anyone. She would never want to put that burden on anyone else, but as her husband, I can't sit and watch her fall apart over it anymore. She has had multiple (12) teeth pulled, and is left with only a few you can see in the front. She only has 1 molar to chew with, and her jaw is constantly out of alignment because of it. She's had multiple root canals (on which quite a few of those were pulled because of similar issues). The few teeth she has are most of the front which look nice, but they are very brittle, and 1 right now has had a root canal and needed a crown 2 yrs ago. Dental implants are extremely costly, and unfortunately don't yet have the $15,000+ needed to make it all right again. ( We've been told it would cost somewhere in that ballpark to fix what she needs) we just haven't been able to correct it. Last week before Christmas, another tooth just broke off. That tooth is needing to get pulled as well. This dead and broken tooth is affecting her health right now and her glands are all swollen. It's just getting worse because things need to happen sooner than later. I just wish as a husband that I could help her out, but financially we aren't able to right now. So I'm asking anyone to help out if they can. Anything helps, and if you know Julie and I, we would never ask for a hand out, and this was my absolute last option. I never wanted to even make one of these things, but she just deserves the best help. She's always putting everyone and everything before her own needs. I want to help her get the teeth she deserves and be confident enough to smile again without feeling self conscious about her them. I thank you all for just taking the time to read this, and if anything just be praying for her and her overall health. God Bless, and feel free to contact me with any questions.",https://images.gofundme.com/cj5OPRSs7qk9BC2FgpI7MKohjsE=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17182524_14835047970_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Christopher O'Morrow is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"$5,700 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/joys-medicaldental-fund,Joy's Medical/Dental Fund,"Joy is my mom and is a wonderful person. On November 14th she woke up with her face completely swollen and bruised and went to the emergency room. She was diagnosed with an abcess with osteomyelitis in her maxilla. Her care was complicated by her heart condition of atrial fibrillation being treated with the blood thinner Coumadin. She also has a pacemaker. She was taken to emergency surgery that night to drain the abcess. The surgeon told me after her surgery that she had severe and acute periodontal disease and would need to have her remaining upper teeth removed to prevent future infections and possible heart complications. She spent 7 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics and went home on antiobiotics for 10 additional days. The dental clinic ( she is on medicare and social security which I personally subsidize so that she doesn't live in poverty) is going to remove her upper teeth but they cannot remove her two back molars because the roots have grown into her sinus cavities and it is too risky for them to remove those teeth because of her heart condition. She needs to go to an oral surgeon to have those molars removed so that she can get an upper denture. I live 550 miles away but drive to her home at least once a month. I also took a 3 week FMLA to take care of her when she was sick in November. I have run out of monetary resources to take care of this for her and would be so very appreciative for any help you can give.

She is very bright and will no doubt make an impact with the children of this crisis.The trip takes place February 9-16. I will be traveling with my friend Jeff Saferite and his daughter Safari. We will assist with food and clothing distribution as well as medical needs. We will also be focusing on, as I stated above, learning from the refugees in order to discern ways we can help them empower themselves. In order to go, I need to raise $6,000.00 by January 24th.

Mary is the ROCK of the family. She never slows down and always puts everyone's needs before hers no matter what the request. This whole thing has really put an enormous amount of stress and guilt on her but you would never known because she never asks for help. She just started chemo on Dec 28th and it is taking its toll on her. She is so sick she can't even leave her bed and that has been so hard for her considering she is always doing something. Not to mention she has to pay for it everytime she goes in which is every two weeks. Plus office visits and anything else associated with the treatment. We have set the goal of this fundraiser at $5,000 for now. Anything donated will go directly towards her bills, copays and chemo.

Yo se que esto no significa un adios permanente sino un hasta pronto madrecita mia. Muchas gracias por todos las bendiciones, apoyo y las oraciones que nos han brindado a mi familia y a mi. On Monday, January 2nd my mother left this world. It hurts my heart to admit that my mother will no longer be with us but I must be strong for my family. She was a strong woman but she had the greatest heart in the entire universe, always putting her children before her, removing the bread from her mouth to give us something to eat. My mother was a very humble and hard working woman and always fought to give us the best. We never lacked food, shoes or much less love even the day before her death my mother got up although very sick and with her swollen feet, she did an effort to cook us our favorite food. Who would know that the strongest woman ever known is gone from this world forever. I know that this does not mean a permanent goodbye, but rather a see you soon mother of mine. My family unfortunately is very limited with money and do not have sufficient savings to pay for the funeral expenses.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/seetheinvisible,Seeing The Invisible Disease Of EDS,"There is so much to explain when it comes to the weird, rare, and seemingly enigmatic disease that is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. In a nutshell, EDS is a collagen deficiency that affects the ligaments and soft tissue in and around my joints. Basically, your ligaments are like taffy. They stretch, and go back. Mine stretch... but won't always go back. This means, my muscles have to be the ones to hold all of my joints together. I've been incapacitated by this disease for over half my life (going on year 16) What this means in terms of (my) symptoms?- subluxation of joints - chronic pain- increased heart rate and heart murmurs - sleep apnea - gastrointestinal shifts (leading to gal stones and extreme abdominal pains)- osteoarthritis- shifting of the jaw/teeth- body temperature fluctuation - extreme muscle spasms - scoliosis - migraines- anxiety and depression- and a bunch of other random stuff that gets really annoying! Here's more insight into that. https://www.gstatic.com/healthricherkp/pdf/ehlers_danlos_syndrome.pdf Needless to say, there are a lot of random, and incredibly unpredictable things that go along with this debilitating and incurable disease. In the recent times, this disease has progressed rapidly in me, and the medical expenses are rising at a rate that insurance will barely cover and are nearly impossible to pay for out of pocket. As of right now, I'm in need of multiple X-rays, MRIs, half a dozen blood panels, physical therapy, pain management care, and around $500 of at-home medical equipment. We need to start taking a deeper look past what we see on the surface, and help those with the invisible diseases.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/3g-jaidas-journey,Jaida's Journey,"Around 7:30pm on Thursday, December 29, Jaida was being her usual daring 4 year old self, when she was leaning back on the high bench at the kitchen table. She went a little too far back, the chair tipped over, and sent her head first toward the hard wood floor. She hit the back of her head, but did not loose consciousness or have any cuts or lumps starting in the area. Mom & dad iced the area while she rested for a bit. They monitored for typical concussion symptoms, and decided if symptoms presented and persisted, an ER visit would be warranted. Jaida threw up about 1 hour later. She consistenly complained of a headache, and was even acting lethargic. This was enough for mom and dad to decide a trip to the ER was needed. On the way to Monticello Hospital, Jaida threw up once again. After a full neuro assessment was completed, the doc determined Jaida had a mild concussion. They administered Tylenol and Zofran, and Jaida seemed stable and hadn't thrown up again for some time. The doc decided to monitor her for a bit longer to see if there were any changes in her symptoms. Almost ready to pack things up and head for home to continue monitoring her, Jaida threw up yet another time. A CT was then advised and ordered. There was no aparent injury from the fall, instead, the CT showed a mass, directly in the center of Jaida's head, which was blocking the ventricles, causing swelling in Jaida's brain (hydrocephalus). By 11:30pm, Jaida was directly admitted to Children's Hospital in Minneapolis for further evaluation.Melissa Hamacher, mother.

For reasons that are hard to understand, Nicholas was taken from us way too soon. He was just 15 years old... he succumbed to a heart condition. His unexpected death has put his family into a complete state of despair, anguish, and disbelief. Nicholas was an amazingly kind and generous young man with a beautiful soul! He loved his immediate and extended family so very much, especially his mother Nikole and father Nicholas Abrego and younger siblings Trinity, Serenity and baby Lincoln. He was best buds with grandma Kathee and was blessed to have known and loved his great grandmother and great great grandmother and many aunts, uncles and cousins. He excelled in high school with a 4.0GPA, was a fanatical Sharks Hockey fan (loved going to the games), a LEGO aficionado, and an avid Disney fan! Words cannot express the sorrow Nikole and Nicholas Abrego (and the entire extended family) are feeling right now. They need our help now! They are in need of money to lay their beautiful son to rest. All proceeds raised will go towards funeral and burial expenses and to help with mounting monthly bills.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lizzie-and-darren,Help Lizzie and Darren,"We have all doubted the universe or the powers that be at times. Why do things happen that we can't control? What we want to know is why can't some people ever catch a break. Enough is enough. Darren and Lizzie are the kind of people who go about their day to day without causing issues for anyone. They are fantastic friends - loyal and kind. They are both good people with warm hearts and beautiful souls. They do not judge and will happily sit back and talk to people they have just met without question. Probably the kind of friends you might take for granted, they'll always be there when you need them. So it didn't seem fair that Lizzie had to battle health issues on and off for years. It wasn't fair when she had to come up against ovarian cancer. It wasn't fair that the job she was in couldn't handle her sickness and let her go. It wasn't fair when Darren returned to work, after having time off for carers leave, that he was made redundant. It's not fair now that Lizzie's fight is in fact not over and that her ""chest infection"" is not actually a chest infection but a spread of the cancer she fought so hard to defeat. It's not fair that she now faces many months (or more) of aggressive chemotherapy and more time off work. It's not fair that no matter how hard Darren tries he isn't able to find work and is now torn between needing to work to financially support both he and Lizzie, but also needing to be home so that he can be around to support Lizzie, his ""wife-like creature"" (and his mum who is currently having treatment for Pancreatic cancer).  The universe is not fair at times, but what we have seen in our time on this Earth, is that the human race can stand together and be amazing. We would like to set up this page to raise as much money as we can for two of our friends who deserve happiness (or at least the right to afford medical treatment, food, rent and just generally the cost of living). We honestly believe that every cent counts and would be so grateful if you lovely people could help us in helping a couple that truly deserve more than the universe is giving them at the moment.",https://images.gofundme.com/Ihisz0eDn479sN6uaLWp1rmihqg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17183726_1483509101.5212.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Hayley Oliver is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,141 raised of $6,000 goal"

In Fact, it’s very rare for an animal to come to us who does not suffer from coccidia, malnutrition, parvo, worms, a hernia, dental issues, upper repertory infection, and occasionally a heart condition.  Many of these illnesses can kill a vulnerable animal.  However usually they are healthy again for less than 50.00 an animal.

Fort Greens unique organic cafe and community hang. In September Basquali was knocked off his motorcycle and badly broke his ankle. A major operation and an extended hospital stay were required. While convalescing, others had to run Smooch because Basquali could not walk. During this time, (when nearly healed) he broke up a fight between his dog (Tokyo, who he rescued from the street) and another. In a melee known to all dog owners, he was bitten. The wound healed, but his bone got infected and became life threatening. Another major operation was required, along with daily hospital visits for life-saving doses of antibiotics, drip fed directly into his infected bone. All this has taken its toll on his body, spirit and finances. Like many Americans, he wasn't 'properly' insured and has acquired equally life-threatening medical bills. It is time for his friends to fight back. We all know Basquali has been a supreme giver of love to us all. And we all have a story or a unique moment of outrageous fun or immense generosity that we owe to him. These moments are by the hundreds because Basquali is a daredevil and he has taunted, mocked and cranked up life to 11 for us all. I now want to hug him from afar with money. It will give him strength and help him heal on every level. And please pray for him and love him in any other way your imagination presents. And do send money, it will help.

A computer. Because as of right now everything is created with just a mobile phone (still am as my old laptop ""kicked the bucket""). The computer would help in many ways from better storage, easement in developing better materials, editing videos and audio, and so much more.2. A video camera. Many aspects of the Diné way of life has not been recorded. So with a video camera we can record those things visually. We learn with our eyes and our ears.

Whether at a soup kitchen, or for the Boy's & Girls Club teaching mechanical skills to groups of 8-10 yrs old boys by way of building remote control cars, or by inviting a stranger to lunch whom he met on a street that sought spare change, or even by keeping spare clothes in his car to give away should the need arise, Gary has always been a humble humanitarian that saw the need for service to others without recognition...As a professional and well respected musician, Gary Hamelin has toured the East Coast with the reverent all original band Stare Down The Sun  which opened the shows for such acts as Rob Zombie, Evenesience, Kitty, and Ra as well as there own sold-out headlining shows...  Garys solid professional musicianship and drive found him in such bands and shows as Linsey LaBelle , John Brandoli , Alternative Nation  (with Josh Enemy and Christopher Piquette), Flat On The Falcetos , Wild Heart - A Tribute To Stevie Nicks & Fleetwood Mac , Good To Be King - A Tribute To Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Perfect Strangers , Fine Grind, Black Thorn, Myriad Eyes (opened for Kings X), and more... Gary discovered that he has what is called Mitral Valve Regurgitation : a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't close tightly, which allows blood to flow backward in the heart... If regurgitation is severe enough, the heart may enlarge to maintain forward flow of blood, causing heart failure (when the heart does not pump enough blood to the body). After a second opinion and much consideration, it was deemed that Gary's condition is very severe and will require full surgery to replace the valve which will render Gary out of work for at least six weeks provided no coplications arise from recovery... then it's very light duty for up to six months... At this time, pre-surgery, Gary has been selling most of his musical gear and tools to make ends meet... He owns his own house with a mortgage, utilities, and car that has already been a strain since his recent divorce, and, which, has not allowed him to build up any savings... Gary at this time is living pay check to pay check, and the anticipated time out of work may very well cost him his home... This Go Fund Me is put together by  a friend of Gary's  in hopes of reaching out to our friends, family, and our community and beyond to assist Gary to meet his living needs and necessities while undergoing this extremely difficult time!",https://images.gofundme.com/a7RGgIxWVPAyrCs78JT3Q7fDw2A=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17184242_1483512467.6499.png,[],0,"Created January 10, 2017",Shane Loiselle is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Gary Hamelin.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,600 raised of $5,000 goal"

That inevitable feeling of abandonment and loneliness and trying to survive one more day. No one wishes to live that sort of life. Unfortunately, there are innocent souls trying to survive that life.For us here in the US, facilities for animal shelters and rescue are common scenarios. This fundraiser is for hurting souls who cannot express their problems and pain. In India, there are many street dogs and other street animals like cows and goats. They are hurt in many ways and fall ill due to the poor conditions. Most of the cases are hit and runs on busy city roads of New Delhi and vicinity. These dogs are rescued from these terrible conditions but still somewhat suffer as they aren't able to fully heal due to lack of proper infrastructure. The institution I have targeted are in dire need of funds to be able to support the animals they rescue.A woman named Anuradha has taken upon this mission of rescuing these dogs in India. Anuradha runs an animal rescue and treatment shelter and they specialize in providing treatment to animals that are critically injured in road accidents or suffered inhumane torture. She has a farmland which was given to her, however it is in terrible condition. Although she has many daily struggles (such as flooding and scorching heat), she has been saving these animals for almost 12 years now. I have brought this cause here to America, in my hometown Las Vegas and now to Baylor University where I go to school and will do my best to aid Anuradha and her team with your help.My fundraiser helps provide medicine, food, clean water, and basic necessities (shelter, mosquito nets, vets' fee for surgeries) for these animals. Eventually when funds are available, we will help build a shelter:) I am a dog lover myself. This is something I am very passionate and determined about and would greatly appreciate your help. Please show your support by contributing or spreading the world about this fundraiser for these speechless souls.A pain killer injection costs 100 rupees ($1.49). Most animals need at least 2-3 injections a day. Currently, they receive the injection once a day or live without it in pain because of the lack of funds.Every cent counts... All donations received through this fundraiser will be personally delivered to the select institution who performs the humane task of helping these animals in distress. This will minimize and in most cases eliminate middleman costs so that the animals receive most of your dollars. In addition to this platform, donations are also being accepted as cash or check.  It would be really appreciated if you could pass on the message. Thank You.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/6h-my-medical-expenses,My Medical Expenses,"Hello my name is Sandra Yvette Diaz, I am 29 yrs old and I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 9.  Due to my diabetes I ran into many complications a diabetic runs into but the problem really started during my pregnancies.  I developed preeclympsia which really took a toll on my kidneys.  One year ago I was told my kidneys were at a 30% functioning.  Due to my diabetes it was to expensive to obtain insurance.  So my family and I were forced to leave to Aguascalientes Mexico due to cheaper health care and since my father's family was there it made it easier for healthcare.  One month ago, I started to have dental issues and it made it easy to me to take some over the counter pain relief medication.  This medication caused my kidney to shut down at a 4%. Which caused me to be hospitalized immediately and get a blood transfusion.  Now I'm getting hemodialysis 3 times a week and pending for a transplant.  At the moment we have a rough estimate of expenses($9,000) and the tranplant($11,000).  My husband and daughter have to travel due to therapy and school coming close for our daughter.  This year has been real rough. Usually we have been able to manage by ourselves but this time it took us by surprise and we were unprepared since we were confident that the kidneys would last another three years.  Anything you can do to help me and my family get through this is grately appreciate it.

Rochelle is a trained vet nurse & an animal rights activist. She is a Wildlife Carer / Rescuer at Hunter Wildlife Rescue, NATF Inc & is Co-founder at The stray cats project. She feeds, catches & pays for desexing colonies of stray cats around the Newcastle, Hunter Valley Region as well as pays for any injured or sick animals veterinary needs. She feeds & looks after these animals better than she looks after herself, the needs of animals of every kind are her priority. Below are a few stories the first story being about a cat she named Pirate. Pirate is the current cover photo, Just took this lovely boy - who I've named Pirate due to the one eye ATM - to Edgeworth Animal Medical Centre as he is a stray from Hamilton Sth commission flats - and was abandoned a few years ago when the owners moved and left him there. He has a bad case of cat flu, one very sore eye and the smell coming from his mouth is putrid as he needs major dental work. Undesexed and unchipped of course. He is going to do a course of vibravet and eye cream and has had a convenia injection - then will see the vet again in 2 weeks and most probably have a dental and be desexed also. He is so sweet and so so friendly…….This is about a bird at her doorWow I must have a sign on my door saying please stop here if you're an animal in need lol - just went down to the servo - got back to find this little one sitting at my front door on one of the perches id collected from the park earlier this week. He doesn't seen injured - just wet and cold - so have brought him in to dry off - he was down far too low - (I almost stood on him till I turned on the front light and realised) and I know there's a few outdoor puddy cats (not mine) around here too….& A story about a lizard, I just released the blue tongue I've had for a few months into the figtree community gardens where it's chemical free - and domestic animal free. Lots of rocky spots to sunbake and lots of low lying grasses and shrubs for cover. He was attacked by a dog after the 10 yo dog who originally lived in his yard and wasn't concerned by the lizards - died and was replaced with an Australian shepherd puppy who wanted to kill him and bit some of his face off. He's completely healed now and he can find food as I've tested him - and he was ready to go now the whether has warmed up. Normally I'd never relocate a lizard but he wasn't going to last long where he had been for ten years unfortunately. Good luck in your new home mate. I hope you like it there.There are lots more stories the list is endless, this page will be an ongoing project even if everyone could donate $5 any little bit will help Rochelle help those animals.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/medical-fund-for-a-new-pacemaker,Medical Fund for Pacemaker Costs,"Hello, my name is Brandon Brizzi. I was born on January 1st, 1981 with a congenital heart defect known as Total Anomalous  Pulmonary Venous Return. TAPVR is when the veins that bring blood back from the lungs don't connect to the left atrium like usual but instead connect back to the heart abnormally which makes it so that the body is not getting the oxygenated blood it needs to survive. This is a life threatening condition. 36 years ago when I was diagnosed with this condition I was taken to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT where open heart surgury was performed, I was just 3 months old. I was given a very small chance to survive, and not without multiple complications including needing to be resusitated, I made it through and here I am today, thank goodness!My childhood went pretty normally. I was very rambunctious and active, giving no signs of a near fatal heart condition, until I was 11 years old. I began to have chest pains periodically. Some were minor and I just ignored them and some were very painful that would debilitate me for up to 30 minutes. I tried to hide them because I was scared but one day I had a really bad one right as I came in the house from playing outside. My mother was in the kitchen and she took notice right away. She helped me get through it and then made a call to set up an appointment to get me checked out.An extensive series of tests were performed over the course of several months. One of the first was a stress test, they put me on a treadmill hooked up to a bunch of wires reading my vitals and had me walk/run for 3 minutes at varying speeds and inclines up to 10 degrees. When I was finished my heart was only beating 42 times per minute. The doctor was in disbelief. I remember him looking at me and then to my mother and saying that he has no idea how I'm still alive.After wearing a heart monitor for 3 months and going through a series of other tests, I was given a pacemaker shortly after turning 12 years old. During these tests they discovered that my heart not only beat much slower than it should have been beating, it also beat sporadically out of rythm to life threatening extremes. They also found that my heart was not the size of an 11/12 year old, but the size of a 7 year old. They suspected that possibly some nerves were damaged during my open heart surgery as an infant causing the abnormal heart growth but there was no way to know for sure. What they did know for sure was that if I didn't get a pacemaker, I would not live to see puberty and I would need a pacemaker throughout the rest of my life. They soon figured out the type of pacemaker I needed and in it went with no complications.Over the course of the next 24 years things went mostly as well as they could be expected. I had regular monthly phone and biannual doctors office checkups to make sure all was well, for the most part everything went without incodent. My second pacemaker when I was 18 had to be put in prematurely because my Atrial lead had gotten wedged underneath my collar bone and severed. My pacemaker still had 3/4 of it's battery expectancy but because the technology had improved so drastically over the course of the previous 6 years, they decided to give me a new pacemaker as well as a new Atrial lead.My third pacemaker came when I was 25. Now here I am at 36 and in need of a new one, but with one major difference, no health insurance. I've been self employed most of my adult life and been lucky to have insurance through parents or my spouse, that is no longer the case. ""Obamacare"" is way out of my reach financially and my spouse is also self employed, neither of us can afford insurance. I've been looking for work with a company that provides insurance but have not yet been hired or offered any positions.It's getting down to the wire. My doctor said that I should not go past March to get a new pacemaker but wants to do it ASAP. The only other option I have is to have the surgery done as self pay and then file bankruptcy afterward. I just can't bring myself to doing that unless it is an absolute last resort.100% of the money donated will go to cover the costs of my medical bills associated with getting the new pacemaker and if more is donated than needed or I obtain employment that provides health insurance, I will refund every penny or divide what's left over equally between every person that donated and give it back.My life is literally on the line. I must have this surgery ASAP. I have a 3 year old daughter that means more to me than anything and I want to see her grow, learn, experience life and be able to walk her down the isle someday. We share an amazing bond and I would never forgive myself if I left her so early in her lifetime.I have debated for several months whether or not to set up this gofundme account, hoping that I would obtain employment with insurance so that I wouldn't have to ask for help. This was a very difficult decision for me to make but I feel that I have no other choice. I want to sincerely thank each and every one of you that donates and if you aren't in a position financially to donate, then please just share this with your family and friends. I will forever hold a special place for you in my heart.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/e6-help-tom-get-back-on-his-feet,Help Tom get back on his feet,"On December 23rd, 2016, I received the phone call that will forever change our lives. I was instructed to call Stanford Valley Care in Pleasanton, where they were bringing my husband via ambulance. Upon speaking with the emergency room doctor, I learned Tom had collapsed at work, had no pulse and had to be shocked five times. While en route to the emergency room the paramedics worked quickly to try to save Tom, they had to intubate him, put a IV into his leg because of urgency and being unable to successfully place one in his arm. Once arriving to the emergency room, Tom was taken back for a CT scan of his brain to check for brain bleeds and signs of a stroke. They discovered that he had fractured his nose during the fall but thankfully the CT scan was clear. Tom's sister, brother, dad and myself rushed to be by his side while his mom and the rest of his family anxiously waited for updates. We were allowed to see Tom after his CT scan. This is a sight that will forever haunt my dreams. Something straight from Grey's Anatomy, the machine breathing for him shook his body so violently, they were trying to induce hypothermia to protect his brain and other major organs. We were told this was protocol after cardiac arrest and prolonged CPR. At this point they told us they were not sure the extent of the damage to his brain because of lack of oxygen for a prolonged time. Tom was moved into ICU, where the placed an central line and continued to induce hypothermia. For the next two days we sat anxiously watching the machines breath for him and lower his temperature. We were told that after 24 hours at hypothermia they would start to warm him. Once warmed, we'd know the extent of the damage. During this time, I received a phone call from his work where they informed me that one of amazing ladies he works with started CPR immediately upon Tom collapsing, this woman is an angel, she saved my husbands life. After the warming process finished, it was time to wake Tom up, this was the second hardest part. He was so lost, so scared and so confused. He was also strong and fighting so hard. Tom woke up fighting, and has continued to fight and be strong. Tom was told her suffered a heart attack that only 5% of people actually survive. He is still in the hospital, working in physical therapy daily to rebuild his strength. He's still struggling with remember the day of the heart attack and even the day before, but all this is common. His brain and major organs at working just fine. His kidneys do have some damage but are getting better daily. Tom will need a angiogram and a pacemaker-defibrillator. The angiogram is to check to blockages and leaks, where the pacemaker-defibrillator is to help prevent something like this from happening again, it will literally shock Tom's heart if he does start to have a heart attack. Tom is very, very lucky to be alive. He does have a very long road a head of him. He is going to be out of work for awhile, leaving myself as the sole provider for our family. Currently we have no health insurance, we were forced to make the decision either feed our kids last month or pay health insurance. On top of all of this we are going to have to have a complete lifestyle change, not just for Tom but for our entire house hold. I am asking for help in making this time easier for Tom. He does not and cannot stress about how we're going to make ends meet right now and how we're going to get us covered. However I can not do it alone, so we are reaching out. Anything helps no matter how small. A simple re share helps so much as well. We want to thank everyone who has prayed for Tom and our families.",https://images.gofundme.com/eqWRuzJokwgV1EYUNOvmvS2q0rc=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17185324_1483518434.0321.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Samantha Dempsey is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Thomas Dempsey.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,815 raised of $5,000 goal"

On December 9, 2016, Barbie was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer at Baguio General Hospital.  Following the diagnosis, she immediately underwent aggressive chemotherapy three times per week for a month. While having chemotherapy, stones were detected in her gallbladder. Chemo treatments were immediately stopped in preparation for Laparoscopy – a surgical removal of the gallstones. The surgery was successful, but doctors found out that her response to chemo treatment was very poor. Barbie must receive reinduction chemotherapy  for nine  (9) weeks as soon as possible which is more intensive, but due to lack of funding, this second treatment is not pushing through. This gave me courage and the urgent need to make this crucial decision to start this Go-Fund-Me campaign. I am appealing to your sense of compassion and I hope you’ll find it in your hearts to please join me in supporting this cause. Your kind support will help offset the financial burden of this family. Donations raised will be directed towards her chemo treatment and other hospital bills. Any amount that you’re comfortable with will go a long way and will be greatly appreciated.  Despite the complexities of her illness and its treatment, Barbie remains strong and positive not just for herself but most especially her three children.Thank you so kindly for visiting this page and hope you'll join me in this campaign — to raise  funds for Barbie's Leukemia treatment.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-randys-medical-expenses,Help with Randy's medical expenses,"******it is with great sorrow that we share that on Thurs Jan 5 in the afternoon (Cameroon time) Randy lost his battle with tetanus. We do not grieve as the world grieves but we do mourn the loss of our Mr Smiles. He will be deeply missed. We want to thank everyone who gave to help with his medical expenses. Just enough came in to cover his hospital stay and we are so grateful for that. Someone has generously offered to pay for his funeral. Thank you so much for all of your prayers and support. We are Tim and Sara Born. Founders of Hope Filled Futures which operate in Cameroon Africa. One of the aspects of our ministy here is Grace Tait Shelter located in a remote village. Just a couple of weeks ago Randy (3 years old) came to live with his sister at our orphanage in Cameroon.  Just days after a Christmas celebration at the orphanage he was rushed to the best hospital in Cameroon (MBingo Baptist Hospital). He was diagnosed with tetanus. If you are unfamiliar with tetanus....the toxins released by the bacteria cause severe spasms/seiures, it is extremely painful and can be the cause of serious complications (broken bones, pneumonia etc..) He is receiving the best possible care here in Cameroon. Medication is given every 2 hours and food every hour...but there were complications. Since he went into cardiac arrest twice they decided to insert a trach tube and feed him via a tube. He has been in the hospital a week. No one expected him to make it through the first night, but he is a fighter. God is answering prayers and the toxins are slowly being purged from his system. We need help covering the cost of his treatment. As he is in ICU....that alone is costing $500 a week (a fraction of cost of care in the U.S. for which we are grateful!). They tell us that he is looking at months of care in the hospital. We need prayer and help with this cost. Please consider how you can help with this. We are so thankful for all of the prayers and support we have received. God is faithful and will bring Randy through this with no lasting effects.

Thank you everyoneGOOD NEWS!On the 20th of February 2017 in the High Court, we were granted leave for a Judicial Review of An Bord Pleanala's decisions to give planning permission for the wind farm and the connection route. The High Court only grants such leave where it considers that there exist substantial legal grounds to justify it; clearly Shehy More fulfills that criteria. The legal challenge is now on and we consider the probability of a successful outcome to be high. Our local fundraising has gone well and as a consequence we are able to reduce the total needed from GoFund Me. However there is still some way to go and to ensure that we meet our goal and save this magical area your continued support is vital. A big thank you to all who have given so generously so far. To keep up to date with where we at check out our Facebook page:    Shehy Wind Action Group OUR BEAUTIFUL SHEHYShehy mountain in West Cork is an iconic landmark; together with the surrounding moorland, forest and small community farms it forms an enviromentally rich and diverse refuge for protected species such as the freshwater pearl mussel, arctic char, white tailed sea eaglels, hen harriers, choughs, deer, otters and many other species.THIS ENVIROMENT IS ABOUT TO BE IRREPARABLY DESTROYED.An 11 turbine industrial wind farm has been given permission by An Bord Pleanala. The turbines will be 131meters high, with massive concrete bases poured into the moorland.There will also be a 38kV (38,000volt) cable laid just under the local roads for 23km.The planning authorities have facilitated the wishes of the wind farm companies and ridden roughshod over the many vital objections of the local community, a community which, as elsewhere in the west of Ireland will now be devasted with families forced to move out of their homes due to noise and shadow flicker. A whole way of life is about to be destroyed to boost the profits of giant British and German hedge funds.We CAN stop this. We have been granted leave for  a Judicial Review in the High Court. We have a very strong legal case and an excellent legal team who to date have won every wind farm case they've undertaken, but it's not cheap and we don't have long.Please help us to save this beautiful area from devastation and give the local people a fighting chance against these industrial corporate interests.Please give generously and ensure that this beautiful, wild and enviromentally diverse area of West Cork can be passed on to future generations.For the planning history visit: http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/MainFrames.aspx   enter 13551  and then 'Documents' tab.For the ABP inspectors report: http://www.pleanala.ie/casenum/246915.htm THANK YOU!",https://images.gofundme.com/UoKV318Io0Ok45tKEcqcZUaPBHg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17185844_1483880426.8375.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17185844_1483882706.665_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17185844_1483882080.7082_funddescription.png']",2,"Created January 8, 2017",Anne Carter is organizing this fundraiser.,Community & Neighbors,"€3,830 raised of €60,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-seat-for-every-student,A Seat for Every Student,"The earthquake that shook in Nepal in 2015 destroyed over 670 schools, leaving children to study in inadequate temporary structures, or worse, unsafe damaged structures. Over the last 7 months hundreds of volunteers have passed through the Prithvi Secondary School construction site in Nuwakot, Nepal to provide nearly 400 students with 2 new sound and safe buildings to learn.  We are so proud of the work that we have completed, but we are not finished yet. Now that the buildings are done, a few crucial things are still lacking... In ten days we will complete the buildings and the children will come rushing into classrooms that will be empty. What is a classroom with out a place to sit? This is where you all come in. The total cost of providing desks made by local carpenters and white boards for almost 400 students is $4900. Any additional funds that we raise will be used for school supplies at the beloved Head Master's discretion. We have given months of our time, buckets of our sweat and tears, and this project has become a part of us and it breaks our hearts to think of leaving it undone. We built a building that we are proud of but we need help to make that building a school.  We are reaching out to those of you who know and love Prithvi Secondary School, and those of you who know how much this project means to us in order to raise these funds in the next 10 days.(one of the damaged structure the school is currently using)If you have any additional questions about the details of how this is all going to go down, or about the school, and the community that is going to benefit, we would love to answer all and any queries.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/fabianacancer,Fabiana Cancer Treatment Fund,"Hola, Tengo 23 años y un futuro por delante. En estos cortos años me han operado dos veces del cerebro, para quitarme unos tumores que me han salido. Al comienzo se pensaban que estos eran buenos (dentro de lo malo, es como si me dijeran tienes la visita de unos vampiros, pero tranquila que son como Edward Cullen), es decir, que no se podrían reproducir ni causar mayor daño, pero en la última biopsia los doctores se dieron cuenta que el tumor era malo, muy malo (tipo Drácula con mucha hambre y enfadado), o una sanguijuela gigante en el cerebro, para que te hagas una idea. Pero el nombre del vampiro esta vez era sarcoma, o mejor dicho gliosarcoma. El 16 de diciembre de 2016, me dan el resultado de mi biopsia y resulto que es un Gliosarcoma Grado IV, tumor maligno poco comun y empezó a resonar una palabra muy grave dentro de mi: cáncer. Es un cáncer cerebral, por lo menos es lo que dice la biopsia, así que pasé de feliz a preocupada, y ahora esforzada en superar este nuevo camino que la vida me está trazando. Ya lo retiraron (el segundo tumor, el malvado), pero es como en esas películas de terror, donde despues de muerto el malo y todos felices, de repente en los segundos finales, salta de nuevo el malo diciendo que volverá. Y así pasó, no ha vuelto, pero hay que  atacarlo con todo lo que se pueda: Radioterapia y Quimioterapia, en fin, es una nueva etapa con diferente necesidades. Antes mi prioridad era recuperar la motricidad de mi lado derecho del cuerpo (que perdí durante la craneotomomía), pero ahora es enfrentarme a un cancer cerebral, eso es como enfrentarme a un Alien, porque ataca por dentro. Pero, estoy segura que podré vencerle, junto a mis doctores, mi familia y tu ayuda.  Si no me conocías de antes, dejame presentarme: Soy Fabiana Fuentes, tengo 23 años, sobreviviente a dos operaciones y tres tumores en el cerebro, que me gusta hacer videos y ver el lado divertido de la vida. Algunos de ustedes quizas conozcan mi historia a traves de Jason Silva (host de brain games) y Ben Jacobson (Northen Lights) quienes me apoyaron (y agradezco infinitamente) en mi campaña de Gofundme para recaudar fondos para rehabilitarme en EEUU con las mejores tecnologias para recuperar mi parte motora del lado derecho, sobre todo mi brazo derecho, por una hemiplejia adquirida a raiz de la primera operacion.Pero hoy mi prioridad es otra, es luchar contra el cancer cerebral. Por la rapidez con que todo ha sucedido debo comenzar mi tratamiento lo más pronto posible. Lamentablemente, en mi país (Venezuela) no se consigue la medicina base de mi tratamiento oncológico: Temozolomida (Temorad - Temozolomide), por lo cual estoy en la necesidad de buscarla en el extranjero sin que sea cubierta por el seguro. Son aproximadamente 360 pastillas (2 por dia, por los proximos 6 meses), en presentaciones de 100 mg y 20 mg (necesito 120 mg por dia), que representa un costo promedio cercano a los 45 mil dolares. Dejo una referencia sobre los costos en Estados Unidos:Una vez culminada la radioterapia (45 días) y si la quimioterapia me lo permite, deseo una consulta en el especializado (en cancer) centro M.D. Anderson en Houston, para ver mi futuro libre del cancer lo más rápido posible. La primera consulta y costos asociados en el M.D. Anderson, incluyen un depósito cercano a los 25 mil dolares, sin incluir exámenes o medicinas adicionales, para ello, incluyendo mi estadía he calculado unos 30 mil dolares adicionales, para lograr una revisión de mi caso, con los médicos top en el tratamiento de los sarcomas en el cerebro. Ayudame a mi y a mi familia, por favor, quiero ganar esta batalla y necesito tu apoyo.  Mil gracias y que se te devuelva toda la ayuda multiplicada por mil.",https://images.gofundme.com/HqnL7k4YywCNPbOX02NXqUZxcQQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483534363.6323.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483536327.3754_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483536796.2893_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483536256.5756_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_fb_1483536001.6107_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483535411.8708_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483609807.7182_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_fb_1483535102.1145_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17186934_1483618923.0795_funddescription.jpg']",8,"Created January 5, 2017",Fabiana Fuentes is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jean  Orduz .,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$4,035 raised of $100,000 goal"

Grady had banged his head at work and things escalated from there. At first he was diagnosed with soft tissue injury receiving a neck brace with discomfort still happening which meant another trip back to the hospital.on November 10 after trips back-and-forth to the hospital during the week with the pain getting steadily worse he started losing mobility in his arms and legs. An ambulance came out that evening after 911 they advised us to wait till the morning to go to Twin Oaks Hospital. So on November 11 we went to twin Oaks Hospital then was rushed by ambulance to Dartmouth General Hospital then was rushed by ambulance again to the QE2 for an emergency MRI. (thankfully) had this not been done he would not be here with us today. They discovered a rare abscess(cervical epidural abscess with neurological defict)  A breathing tube was inserted and emergency surgery was done with not knowing what the outcome would be. We are grateful to have him pull through this with a long recovery to come in the next few months.Grady has started showing more and more improvement as each day passes. The ability of moving hands and arms to taking his first steps  over again has been very welcoming to the heart needless to say. He also has a constant tingle that goes down his body down his arms to his fingertips and down his legs to his toes all due to nerve damage caused from the abscess. He has sensitivity through his entire body which causes pain from just a soft touch, we are hoping that this may in time go away but Doctors say there's no guarantee. Only the future will hold the answer.Grady's positive outlook and drive to beat this is what, we have to say has been awesome. He has not once looked behind but ahead to the future our new motto is ""one day at a time"". He is now at the rehab centre with a long road ahead.We are hoping to raise funds to ease the burden of the next few months so he can focus on his recovery. As we all know bills still need to be paid. As Grady is self-employed, funds have now seized since the injury occurred and work will not be in the very near future. Only time will tell.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/lvhs-stem,STEM Lab Makerspace,"Loudoun Valley STEM Lab FundraiserWhere we’ve been: a bit of backgroundLast year we decided to see if the students at Valley would like to work on STEM-related projects.  We had an interest meeting and had a standing room only turn out…and so the Loudoun Valley STEM Club was born.  We sought out a project to work on and found the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition.  It offered us a project goal to work on throughout the year and had the added bonus of being community-centric.  The club came up with seven ideas and settled on creating an Emergency Alert System for the W&OD Trail.  The students felt strongly about this project because many of our students use the trail to get to and from school.  The trail is also used heavily by our community for recreation and exercise.The club worked diligently and steadily progressed through the contest first becoming a top five in state finalist and then clinching the top Virginia spot.  Since we met as a club and not a regular class period as many other competitors, students worked mornings before school and on weekends.  When we were out of school for a solid week, we met at our homes.  The video the students created made the club one of fifteen National Finalists and meant a trip to New York city to present before a live judges panel at Samsung’s multimedia complex, 837.  When the dust settled, out of an original pool of over 4,100 entries, our STEM Club’s project was named one of just 3 National Winners!Our first-year STEM Club on the W&OD with one of the nodes that make up the Emergency Alert System.Where we are: STEM arrives at ValleyOur club won a $120,000 award of Samsung technology for STEM education at Loudoun Valley.  With these Samsung products, we have established a STEM Lab in Room 302 offering students access to new 4k laptops with external 32” HD monitors.  We have several technologies including VR googles, SmartWatch, regular and large format tablets and a digital camera.  Out of our award, we also gave a classroom set of Chromebooks to the school and a workstation like the ones in the STEM Lab to the newspaper, yearbook, and art department.Where we are headed: STEM Lab ExtraordinaireNow we want to complete the STEM Lab and make it a true hi-tech lab where Valley students can not only investigate but create.  With the computing workstations we have, students are able to program for multiple platforms using multiple languages and create games or applications, play with 3D modeling, and investigate anything they are curious about. While our award was substantial, it was only for Samsung technology and there are many facets to STEM for which Samsung does not make the necessary products. We are raising money to purchase equipment to establish centers for Robotics, Electronics (including but not limited to Arduinos and Raspberry Pis), 3D Printing, and even Drones.  All funds raised will go towards supporting the STEM Lab, purchasing equipment and supplies students will be using.  The STEM Lab is open and free to use for any Valley student.As part of our fundraising efforts, we have received a grant from LEF and Orbital ATK with a matching grant.  Thanks to that, we now have robotics equipment that we have been assembling. So we are off to a great start! Please consider making a donation and helping us create a model STEM Lab for our Valley community. Note: For tax-deductible donations, please see our Facebook page for more information on how to make your donation. Thank you.Loudoun Valley STEM Supporters",https://images.gofundme.com/SYHrpHT3pgjw_91Uwl6FjQ00BSI=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17187220_1483537330.6252.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17187220_1483581682.2012_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17187220_1484918029.9275_funddescription.png']",2,"Created January 4, 2017",Kay Schnee is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$3,000 raised of $15,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/5g-katelins-army,Katelin's Army,Hi my name is Jess Thompson.  I am Katelin Shipp's older sister. I have created this gofund me to try and help my little sister why she focuses on fighting the greatest fight not only of her life but for her life. To help you know who and why you are donating too if you choose to do so I will tell you a little bit about katey. Katelin is currently 20yrs old soon to be 21 on the 30th of Jan 2017. She is currently in the icu of John hunter hospital. She has cystic fibrosis which she was born with. Katey has had to struggle every single day of her life and she has always done so with a smile on her face and love in her heart. Life hasnt been easy but she has always kept fighting no matter what. Katelin is at a stage in her life where in order to lead a fulfilling life she needs to have a double lung transplant asap. It is life or death. She is currently attatched to countless breathing machines to keep oxygen in her lungs and try and drain c02 from them as it is dangerously high atm. A healthy persons c02 levels should range between 25% and 35%. Katelins levels reached 90% on monday night and are currently sitting at 74%. The levels have been fluctuating even with the machines helping. Not too mention the machine that helps lower the c02 levels also puts her in excruciating pain at the same time.Like everybody else life cant stop for katelin and she still has bills that need to be paid and now has added expenses due to being in hospital. Katelin lives in dubbo and will either be in Newcastle hospital or fingers crossed Sydneys transplant hospital if and hopefully when she is added to the top of the transplant list.  Living away from home and family also costs a lot of money.  As katelins family and army for health we are reaching out for anybody that could donate anything even a dollar to help katey with the cost of living while she is in hospital and for once she can finally get home and back on her feet. This way she  doesn't need to worry about money and can focus 100% on fighting this fight. Katelin is not one to have her hand out and works hard for everything she has and we all really appreciate any donations and kind words and support you may be able to offer her atm. We are all  katelins army and want nothing more than to see her make a full recovery xxThank you everybody xx,https://images.gofundme.com/IzhhEF6lkqvaMIeUW_V7QAkh8F8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17187228_1483536623.1436.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Jessica Thompson is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$10,256 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/yu-katies-surgery,Surgery Complications,"I was a United States sailor who was medically separated due to a knee that went to garbage. My husband was also Military, a Marine Iraq veteran. We both know what hard work is all about and both work full time jobs now as civilians. Unfortunately I have been draining us financially because of the health problems I will list below. I am also an avid hunter, a bow hunter, and currently I am too sick to pull my bow back. We do our best to live well within our means, but between Obamacare taking its toll on healthcare and insurance my medical bills are now thousands of dollars. Not to mention the year just started so all my coinsurance and deductibles that I had paid off last year no longer apply. I underwent a surgery on December 13th called a Nissen Fundoplication and a Diaphramatic Hernia Repair and although the surgery itself was successful the days following the surgery have been filled with several complications that have caused the medical bills to go through the roof.  My hospital stay was only supposed to be two days and turned into five due to an ileous, which caused my intestines to shut down. With hopes that it would resolve on its own I went home so I could spend Christmas with family. The day after Christmas however, I ended up back in the hospital. After that I had a follow up with my doctor where we learned I had a rare disorder called Nutcracker Syndrome. We are now waiting to see if I will have to have another surgery to fix this or if it too will resolve. I have also developed a new structure in my esophagus that very possibly could require surgery to dial are and fracture it in order to give me back my ability to swallow food. I have never asked for a hand out in my life and hate that a gofundme account is something that has to be done to keep me and my husband afloat. He is working every day of the week and takes care of me full time. We are newly married and it has been amazing to say the least. He has been there for me every single step of the way.  I have also, already taken out a loan to pay some of the medical costs but as more problems arose, that money quickly disappeared.I know the goal was set for a lot, which will only put a dent in the bills that have started to pile up, but every little bit will help.",https://images.gofundme.com/umNy6LpZ4Dnkeg04I8g712hJ134=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17187516_1484150750.4353.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Katie Faulkinberry is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,750 raised of $5,000 goal"

We have now raised enough to send three of our four candidates. Hoping to raise enough to send our fourth. Thanks for your supportMay 16, 2018 Update - Latest use for money raised is to sponsor one Maine camper to attend the University of Maine 4-H Camp & Learning Center at Bryant Pond. Details at the public group Ellis Pond Sidekicks on FB.6/17/17 Update - Thanks again to everyone who has donated. The presentation Roxbury Pond - Water You Want To Know?, which was funded by this campaign, had a low turnout but it was a good cross section of the community. Everyone who attended got a lot out of it and I think some good conversations will happen because of it. The current balance after covering the presentation expenses is a little under $50. I've committed $70 for two $35 tickets to go to a member of my facebook group, Ellis Pond sidekicks. These tickets are for the VLMP annual conference on July 29. On my wish list, if more donations come in, is covering lab fees for some pond water analysis of samples to check the phosphorus concentrations. The fee is $25 plus shipping per sample. Would like to do at least two samples this year.5/30/17 Update: We've almost raised enough money to cover the June 13 Roxbury Pond - Water You Want To Know Event! Money raised over and above that need will be used down the road in other ways to benefit the pond.4/17/17 Update: Ice out is right around the corner which for me signals the start of a new year. To help welcome the new open water season, I'm planning a public presentation in Andover related to pond water quality issues. Details should be available in a few weeks. My budget for the presentation is $350 and I currently have a balance of just under $100. Even if you aren't able to attend the presentation if you'd like to help me meet my goal, a modest donation of $5 or $10 would certainly be appreciated.2/2/17 Update: Enough money has been raised to purchase the meter! Donations would still be appreciated so that I can build a rainy day fund to cover the cost of replacement parts and other projects down the road.  See 2/3/17 update for more info. That is in the Updates section.1/28/17 Update: Great news to report related to the fundraiser. When offline donations are included, we are getting very close to the goal. Some of the money over and above the goal will be put aside in a rainy day fund to be saved for replacement parts that will be needed at some point. If there is even more than is needed for the rainy day fund, I'll see that it benefits the watershed in some way.I am one of the Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program's (MVLMP) volunteer lake monitors for Ellis Pond, aka Roxbury Pond, aka Silver Lake. I've held this position with MVLMP for over two decades. My wife is also certified as an MVLMP monitor. She is getting close to year 10. One of the key pieces of equipment that we use every two weeks during open water season is a dissolved oxygen meter, also known as a DO meter.As you can see from our fundraising goal, these instruments are not inexpensive. In addition, they don't last forever. The meter that we're currently using, which was supplied by the local lake association, is showing signs of nearing the end of it's useful life after close to twenty years of reliable service. Given our concern about the continued reliability of the current meter, the time has come for us to upgrade to a new meter of our own before starting my 2017 round of monitoring in late April.To help us meet the goal of purchasing our own DO meter, please consider a donation of $5 or $10. Larger donations certainly would be appreciated but our target is to see a large showing of grass roots' support in the way of small donations from dozens of people instead of reaching out here for larger donations from a few people or organizations. In advance, thank you for your support.If the new meter is still reliable when we retire as MVLMP's  Ellis Pond monitors, We'll donate the meter to MVLMP for them to pass on to the next person that they certify to take dissolved oxygen readings at the pond. To learn more about MVLMP, please check out this link ...  http://www.mainevlmp.org/ The following link contains info on various lake water quality indicators, including dissolved oxygen ... http://www.mainevlmp.org/programs/water-quality-monitoring/water-quality-indicators/ A video of the DO meter that is being considered is at this link ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymghdHGmCRM",https://images.gofundme.com/r7DbzjxLSheNgOkjATNziKRiJ6o=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17187590_1557579543210032_r.jpeg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Ross Swain is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$2,280 raised of $3,000 goal"

Blessings and many thanks.  Monday, without any kind of warning Jeff went into a gran mal seizure that lasted over 15 minutes, then in another 10 minutes he went into another one. This happened four times. He had 4 gran mal seizures in a matter of 50 minutes. He aspirated the chew that was in his mouth. He's staying sedated and intubated right now. There are no signs of pneumonia right now. We are extremely humbled and grateful for all of the help we have received thus far, and it pains me to put this out there again. We can not wait until the time we can start giving it back. I was fired from my job at Target the day before I was supposed to go on leave for Jeff's implant surgery.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ins-deductible-for-tornado-damage,Ins deductible for tornado damage,"My mother Pat Lanier has had a run of bad luck this last year especially. Her homeowners insurance company dropped her coverage last year due to things that were out of her control. There are many old trees in her neighborhood, and she removed most from her yard because big limbs were falling daily. Limbs from her neighbors' yards continued to cause damage to her house and power lines. Because of this, she had to file claims on her insurance because she was still held responsible. Well, in order for another insurance company to pick up coverage (much lesser coverage at that) on her house she had to do about $3000-$4000 worth of work. She just completed all of this work just a few short months ago. Now, the night of January 2nd, a tornado took up residence of her home for just a few minutes causing her dining room and kitchen to flood due to rainwater. All damage that was done was the result of her neighbors' trees again. She also has two apartments in her back yard she rented out for income that sustained significant damage as well. The deductible for her house is $3000 and she has a separate deductible for the apartments that is $3000 as well. I could see where if she hadn't already depleted her funds to make repairs to her home, or even be able to stay on her other insurance that had a much lower deductible, this would not be as devastating to her. In addition to this, my daddy's car was also damaged, and that's another deductible. It's not as much money, but it's additional problems. My mother is 70 years old and my father is 65. They can't do a lot. My brother who lives in the neighboring town helps them out a lot, but he can only do so much due to long working hours and being a single father to 2 small children. I can't help because they're in GA and I'm in AR.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/glenda-hanks-ms-stem-cell-treatment,Glenda Hanks MS stem Cell Treatment,"Please Help Me Beat Multiple SclerosisHello, my name is Glenda Hanks, I was diagnosed with Relaxing and Remitting Multiple Sclerosis in 2003.  Multiple Sclerosis or MS, is an incurable auto-immune process where the immune system attacks myelin – the fatty substance that insulates the nerve fibers (the myelin sheath) and keeps the nerves themselves healthy.  When the myelin is damaged it forms scar tissue which gives the disease its name of sclerosis.  When the damaged myelin sheath or the nerve fiber is damaged or destroyed, the nerve impulses sent out by the brain and spinal cord are distorted or blocked, resulting in many symptoms impact daily life functions.  When I was diagnosed in 2003, I was 26 years old and newly married to my husband Hap.  As scary as the diagnosis was, we were determined to live our lives and not let MS interfere.  We wanted to have a family, own a home, pursue our careers – the dream of all young couples.Initially my symptoms were minor and tolerable.  So much so, and with the blessing of my doctors, we decided to have a child.  Our son Noah was born in 2007.  Noah is the joy of our lives, a wonderfully kind boy who excels in school and has a personality that fills any room!  We knew there was a risk of the disease picking up steam after having a baby and in my case, that is now happening.  I am now 40, and have sclerosis lesions on both my brain and spinal cord.  I have decreased mobility and balance, spasticity(involuntary tightening of the muscle) in my left leg,  a decrease in my cognitive function and brain atrophy.  I am unable to walk any distance and my left leg is quickly losing its function.  Hap and I have been fortunate to have health insurance from my employment that has covered most of my treatment. I have resisted using a wheelchair and will continue to do so for as long as I can.  What is troubling me the most is that MS is preventing me from being the wife and mother I want to be.  I have difficulty doing chores that seem simple to most people.  Our son Noah is an active boy, he studies karate and participates in tournaments and, he is very social.  Probably one of the most frustrating and emotionally devastating issues for me is that I am frequently unable to attend his events.  He’s sad and I’m sad.  I am very blessed to have a husband that has willingly and lovingly taken on many of our day-to-day tasks. I have tried all the therapies my doctors have recommended and still my symptoms continue to increase in severity.  I am uncomfortable complaining about my daily struggles.  Currently I am giving myself shots of Copaxone three times a week.  I have excruciatingly painful side effects which is pretty common with all MS therapies.  There are experimental stem cell treatments and therapies available for autoimmune diseases such as MS at a few major health care facilities. One in San Diego, CA called StemGenex and another in St. Petersburg, FL. called StemMedix. StemGenex sponsors its stem cell clinical studies through the National Institutes of Health. The program is reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional review board to ensure proper oversight and protocols are being followed.  More can be viewed at www.clinicaltrials.gov/stemgenex.  As with all clinical trials, health insurance does not cover experimental therapy. StemMedix offers Autologous stem cell therapy - a regenerative treatment designed to use the patient’s own adult stem cells to repair and replace diseased tissue in the body. Past treatments have shown that adult stem cells not only have the potential to regenerate lost or damaged myelin sheath tissues, but also have the ability to modulate the immune system, temporarily disabling the abnormal attack.We have done our research and we are very encouraged by the stem cell clinical trial at StemGenex.  The damage to the myelin sheath is what is believed to cause the ‘relapses’ MS patients experience.  Over time these relapses permanently damage the myelin, leading to progression of the disease.  This encouraging new therapy targets the myelin sheath nerve cells in a process called remyelination.  It also targets the immune system to repair itself and prevent it from attacking itself in a process called immunomodulation.  These two therapies have shown great promise for MS patients by stopping or significantly slowing the progression of the disease.  What a dream and miracle this would be for our family!We have a long journey and fight ahead of us, and with the funds we raise here we hope to alleviate some of the financial challenges that come with participating in a clinical trial.  The work being done across the country to find a cure for MS by using stem cell therapy is one of the most promising to date however, it takes willing participants to help these trials succeed.  Just think of what this will mean for MS patients when the clinical trials result in FDA approved therapies covered by insurance.  We are very thankful for each and every day of our lives and are blessed in so many ways.  With your help we can do our part to help find a cure for MS.  No donation is too small!",https://images.gofundme.com/KK3EHGnYe-vje0l6nyrg9SO6twA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188214_1483990714.2475.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Glenda Hanks is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$17,535 raised of $18,000 goal"

In addition to caring for her adult daughter with special needs, Kristie also has a 15-year-old daughter and is the primary caregiver of her 18 month old granddaughter. The next few months are going to be very difficult for her family. Kristie would never ask for assistance, so I decided to do that for her instead.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/emilytaylorkelso,Emily's Album Fund,"For my entire life, I've been in love with music. I've been writing songs since I was 9 and I taught myself to play guitar when I was 12. I've written hundreds of songs and made an effort to record a fraction of them in a makeshift music studio set up in my bedroom.This coming summer will be my last full summer at home, so the timing is perfect. This summer I want to spend my last four months of freedom recording a full-length, professionally produced album.Unfortunately, with the cost of post-secondary education these days, it's going to be difficult to afford studio time, CD production, distribution, and even the photo sessions for the album cover and booklet. That's why I'm here: I'm asking for some help from my family, friends, supporters, and music lovers in general (especially country music lovers!). With your donations, I can make this lifelong dream of mine a reality.I’ll start working on the album in May 2017 and it will be released in the fall of 2017 (most likely October/November). If it goes according to plan, it'll consist of 12 tracks: 10 original country songs, and 2 covers of some very familiar and beloved country songs. An album has been my dream since I was 2 years old, and this is finally the perfect time to make it happen!I'm hoping to raise $2,000 from this campaign, although the total costs of the album will be over $5,000. Any donations will be greatly appreciated.

He went on to serve in the Army and while we will never truly know what caused Randy to live on the streets of Rio Linda, I can say that he was always pleasant to speak with. He was usually found on M and Front street, near the gas station, next to Nu Way Market, at Depot Park, or sleeping behind the old Button Works. Randy was a friendly man who never bothered anyone. Although it is tragic that his life ended this way, we are comforted in knowing that through his death, others will be able to get a second chance at life.

CT scans revealed bleeding on the brain which doctors attributed to a blow to the head Mike may have had a couple weeks prior while jumping into his boat. He received a diagnosis of a severe concussion and was sent home. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, he lost almost 15 pounds as symptoms worsened, and on Nov 11, he was back in the ICU. At this time, tests revealed Stage 4 mestatic melanoma with double bleeding in the brain, and tumors in the brain, lung and kidney. An aggressive treatment plan involving radiation and chemotherapy were to commence soon thereafter. On 12-2, Mike's 56th birthday, he started radiation treatments which ended on 12-20. Oral chemotherapy began in December which he will be on through January. Subsequent tests and scans will determine results of his current treatments, and help doctors work out future plans for Mike. Mike was born in Alabama in 1960, served our country in the US Air Force for 6 years, and met the love of his life, Susan, in San Antonio whom he's been married to for 27 years. They have 3 children, Sarah, Abby and Noah, and 2 grandchildren, Kellen and Nate. They attend church at North Cities UPC, where they've been members since 2001. Anyone that knows Mike well, knows that he loves the Lord, his family and his friends. He also loves the outdoors, and is an avid fisherman. Over the years he's led countless fishing guide trips yielding great results for happy clients and friends. Mike has been unable to work or get out and do much of anything since October. He is a seasoned mortgage loan officer, and has been with his current employer a little less than a year. Because of his reduced work hours and length of service at his company, his benefits and monthly income are reduced drastically.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/federally-legalize-hobby-distilling,Federally Legalize Hobby Distilling,"Our GoalThe Hobby Distiller's Association (HDA) has been advocating for legalization of hobby distilling in America since 2014. Our goal is to finally give hobby distilling the same legal standing already afforded to hobby brewing and wine making. To do this, we need to conduct a proper federal advocacy and lobbying campaign.   While we have had marked success with our current DC representation (more on that below), it has required significant resources.  Unfortunately, while it is essential that we keep fighting for equal treatment, we are unable to do so without additional funding.The Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2019 (H.R.1175 & S.362) was introduced in February of 2019. We need to hire our lobbyist back to negotiate in getting a section about legalizing home distilling added.Our ExpensesThe HDA currently operates as a division of Brewhaus America due to lobbying restrictions placed on non-profit organizations (if the HDA were set up as a traditional non-profit, we would have to stop paying our lobbyist once we ran out of funds collected from membership). Our current structure, however, has allowed Brewhaus to pay our lobbyist to work towards legislative changes beyond what membership dues cover, which has been over $60,000 to date.  The money raised from this campaign will go directly to hire and pay our lobbyist for one year.Our ProgressIn 2016, we came closer to legalizing hobby distilling than any organized effort has ever come before.  The Craft Beverage Modernization & Tax Reform Act introduced in both the House and Senate (H.R. 2903 and S. 1562, respectively), both included provisions legalizing hobby distilling with certain limitations.  In the House, the measure had 288 cosponsors, and in the Senate, the bipartisan tally came to 51 cosponsors.   We were excruciatingly close last year, and we simply need more funding if we want to see this through to the finish line.While lobbying is typically extremely expensive, HDA is fortunate to work with Lobbyit.com, a firm providing professional advocacy services for a fraction of the cost of the rest of the industry.   While other forms charge $15-$20k/mo. for federal advocacy, Lobbyit charges a fraction of that.  As a result, we have achieved our progress for a relatively modest sum.  We need to keep up the effort.Below is a timeline of our accomplishments since we formed in 2014.March 2014: Hobby Distiller’s Association founded and hired our lobbyist.June 2014: Our lobbyist meets with several senators in DC and organizes an initiative for HDA leadership to meet with members of Congress as well.September 2014: HDA leadership, members of membership committee, and HDA lobbyist meet with Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, Representative Michael C. Burgess, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in multiple trips to Washington DC.October – January 2014: Language for a bill that would legalize home distilling as a hobby is drafted with the help of Legislative Counsel.February 2015: HDA leadership and HDA lobbyist meet with the Senate Finance Committee as well as the Assistant Secretary of Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury.June 2015: The HDA bill was rolled into a much larger bill called the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2015 and introduced in both the House and the Senate (S.1562 and H.R.2903).September 2016: HDA leadership and HDA lobbyist meet with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).October 2016: Over 65% of the entire House of Representatives, representing 47 states including the District of Columbia, have signed on as cosponsors of H.R.2903. Also, 51% of the entire Senate, representing 31 states, have signed on as cosponsors of S.1562.May 2017: We've had to pull the plug on our lobbyist for the time being due to lack of funding. It costs $3000/month to pay for a lobbyist, and we have been unable to sustain that from membership dues and donations. Any funding earned from this point on is now being saved in an account to go towards hiring him back.Keep in mind that you don't have to be a hobby distiller yourself to support this cause. Perhaps you are a friend, family member, or co-worker to someone who is interested in hobby distilling. All we want is for hobby distillers to enjoy the same legal standing as hobby brewers and wine makers. Any donation is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support.For those who do not know what hobby distilling is, please check out the Hobby Distiller's Association .If you are unable to donate, please like us on Facebook and spread the word about our cause so we can garner enough public support to show Congress that we are serious about this.",https://images.gofundme.com/sCqpVyjvhxEQtePioUFr17ub-Ao=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188554_1483542618.3901.png,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188554_1483568526.4254_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 4, 2017",Rick Morris is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Hobby Distiller's Association.,Other,"$1,620 raised of $30,000 goal"

Time is of the essence as we need to start purchasing the advertisements within a couple of weeks - any amount will help as we would like a large number of donors as an indication of the widespread support for this important initiative - so please consider donating to help us bring new schools to Amherst!!!,https://images.gofundme.com/SZr0Rze-m2xM7PZi1aXHsBHiaDw=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188588_1483542591.3099.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",John Wells is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Heather Sheldon.,Education & Learning,"$2,719 raised of $3,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/comfort-and-support-for-jon-david,Comfort and Support for Jon David,"Jon David is a handsome, sweet, and resilient 3 year old little boy who has overcome more challenges in his few years than most adults have been through in their lifetime. JD was born into the foster care system. When he was 2 he was moved to a new foster family & right away his foster parents fell in love with this child.       One day his foster mom took him to the doctors for a runny nose and when they took his blood pressure reading, it was sky high.  That's when Jon David was subsequently diagnosed with Wilm's tumor, which is a form of kidney cancer. He has spent a large portion of his short life in the Arkansas Children's hospital battling this cancer. Doctor's were pretty sure they had it beat and then Jon David finally got some permanency and stability in his life in March of 2016 when he was legally adopted by his foster parents!       However, it wasn't long and JD's cancer had returned...worse than before. The tumor on his liver is massive. It has spread from his kidneys to his liver, lungs, and his chest wall.  His parents were told by doctors yesterday that it was no longer treatable. There is nothing else that medically can be done to help Jon David. If you live in or around Springdale you may have seen his face on the Children's hospital billboards in town.      Jon Davids doctors and his mom and dad have made the decision to bring JD home to be made comfortable and live the rest of his life out. His mom still asks for everyone's thoughts and prayers but now they are just asking for prayers of comfort. We have created this campaign on behalf of JD and his family in order to raise funds to support Jon David in these months he has and to go towards final expenses. The last thing a parent should have to worry about is money when their child has been given months to live. Please consider a donation to help Jon David's dad take some time off work to spend with him, help the family have money to make memories with this sweet baby boy and his siblings, and to relieve the financial burden from his mom and dad's shoulders during this time.Adoption Day!!",https://images.gofundme.com/g8Z5Np9shus52iyVm6hUOJwzPGo=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188634_1483542746.5611.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188634_1483563770.8976_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188634_1483563787.2632_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188634_1483563800.3302_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188634_1483563827.3339_funddescription.jpg']",4,"Created January 4, 2017",Stephanie Riggins is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,885 raised of $10,000 goal"

That means that the infection consisted of over 15% of her body weight.  Thankfully she made it through the surgery and she is on the road to recovery.  The problem we have now is funding.  Vicky was in such poor condition that she had to stay overnight under emergency care.  Her frail body needed IV fluids, antibiotics, supplement and most of all pain killers.  She will need to have a full blood panel done today.  When CARE of DC stepped up to help Vicky we did it without thought of what the cost would be.  We saw an extremely ill and emaciated dog and we wanted to help.  Initial estimates for Vicky’s total recovery are about $2,500.  If you could find it in your heart to donate towards her care we would be extremely grateful.  Take a look at the photos.  Vicky has been through so much.  She was starved, neglected and not given proper veterinary care.  Let’s all chip in and give her the life that she deserves.   CARE of DC is a registered 501C3 organization so your contribution is tax deductible.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/lovejodie,In Loving Memory of Jodie White,"On the 28th of December, just a day after her 25th birthday, my fiancee was snatched away. Jodie White was (and still is) a true example of love and strength. She was a much-loved mother to our three year old son, a sister, a daughter, an aunty, a cousin, and a friend to so many... not to mention the other half of me.  Jodie suffered from sickle cell anaemia and on the morning of the 26th of December she was admitted into hospital due to a crisis. I stayed there with her on the evening of the 26th, when she would’ve been at her surprise birthday party, throughout her birthday on the 27th, until the 28th, when the duration of the immense pain she had endured caused her strength to run out, and she sadly passed away.One of the funniest, vibrant people you'd ever meet, she was able to easily brighten up any room she stepped into. She would tell you things straight, she was never one to beat around the bush, but you always knew where you stood with her and knew she'd forever have your back.An amazing powerhouse of a vocalist, she was more comfortable than she knew on the stage. Her voice touched even those that she never have personally met. Jodie's soul really shone through when she sang from the heart. Hearing her imagination and creativity run rampant as she messed around at home easily makes her a musician that I will alway respect and admire.I witnessed the sheer power of will in this woman on a day-to-day basis and she will forever remained a beacon for my own growth as a person as well as a parent for our son. The outburst of emotions and impact of her passing just goes to show the abundance of love we shared for her. I can honestly say that I couldn’t spiral too far even if I tried, for the emotional support is so uplifting. She will always remain a light in the darkness; a true superstar my soul will never forget.With this fundraiser, we hope to raise some contributions towards Jodie's funeral and burial. The date of the funeral is the 24th of January 2017. You don’t need to feel obliged to donate, this is just an optional way to help if you can.I don't really know how to end this plea, I can only hope to achieve the goal to give my lady a send off even half worthy of her.I cannot thank everyone enough for the overwhelming support through these times.",https://images.gofundme.com/CrV35kbRg-xf_I6qWj1jApzzODc=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188750_1483543274.8342.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Nick Uncoole Joseph is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"£2,920 raised of £4,000 goal"

One day little Madi started having trouble swallowing, she was not sure how to explain this to her parents at the age of 6, so she said she swallowed a coin. The doctors did an X-ray, although they did not find the coin, they instead found a much larger problem. Doctors found that the aortic arch from her heart goes in the opposite direction forming a vascular ring thus constricting her esophagus and trachea, so she is having major difficulty breathing and swallowing. Her parents were told that she would need heart surgery right away. This came as a huge shock. After many tests, they were able to find a surgeon at Texas Children’s who would be able to perform the surgery. There were a lot of complications that could have arisen from a surgery of this nature, but fortunately the surgery was successful! Now Madi will have to be out of school a minimum of 5 weeks for recovery and potentially physical therapy for her left arm mobility. Both of her parents will need to balance being off work along with taking care of her and their other children. Madi has a twin brother named Jacob that is also in kindergarden and an older brother named Gabriel that is is in third grade. Her mother is Barbara Lucero, our Adolphus' wonderful secretary.Please pray for Madison's total and complete healing by our gracious Heavenly Father and consider donating to help her family with medical expenses during this difficult time.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/syrian-refugee-camp-mission-trip,Syrian Refugee Camp Mission Trip,"My name is Ann Whitfield Carter and I am on the ministerial staff staff at Richmond's First Baptist Church in Richmond, Virgina. In November of 2015, I, along with 7 others from First Baptist Church, spent a week in a refugee camp in Croatia...and I had no idea how my life & perspective would change, how my heart would be torn open or how my soul would be touched so deeply and so permanently. And I long to do it all over again. I have watched and waited for over a year...my eyes open, my suitcase not too far away, and my passport up to date, wondering what I am supposed to do next. Well. Now I know! Five of our original team are returning to Greece January 11-20 to work in a refugee camp in Thessaloniki, near the Macedonian border. It will be so different from Croatia where we encountered thousands of refugees every day. In Thessaloniki, we will work in a former military base that is not filled with 350-400 refugees - mainly families with children. They have been waiting in this camp for months, wondering if they can resettle in western Europe or if they must return to Turkey or even Syria. Many of you have asked how you can support the work we are doing and now I have a way you can help. You can provide funds so that we can purchase supplies in Greece to meet the need we encounter in the lives of the refugees - soccer balls for the children, hats, coats, scarves, socks for children, toiletries, healthy snacks, underwear for women, crayons, books and blankets. We can carry a few things in our bags, so if you have some of the above items to donate, feel free. But so much of what we need we can purchase there with the added benefit of stimulating the local economy a bit. Please know that 100% of what you give will go directly to supplies for the refugees. Thank you for donating. Thank you for caring about a cause so near and dear to my heart. Thank you for enabling us to be the hands and feet of Christ in practical ways to people in desperate need. In order to be transparent as possible, I want to let you know some details about what we will be doing, who we will be doing it with and how your money will be spent.First of all, we will be working in Camp Veria in northern Greece to do what we can to meet the needs of the camp residents. When we arrive, we will assess the needs there based on the information we recieve from Bridge2Refugees, CBA and our own observation. Once we determine what the greatest need is, we will make plans to purchase whatever is needed. From what we know 5,000 miles away, we will most likely be purchasing food for the free supermarket in the camp, hats, clothes, gloves, scarve for the clothing store, personal hygiene items. Their biggest need right now is fresh, local food for the free supermarket.Secondly, we will be partnering with Croatian Baptist Aid, the organization we worked with in Croatia. Once the borders closed, CBA traveled to Greece to work in camps there. We will meet up with CBA in Veria, Greece and together we will partner with Bridge2Refugees, a nonprofit organization that provides food, clothing and other supplies to refugees living on the streets and in Camp Veria.You can check out both of their Facebook pages for more information. We have been in contact with Bridge2 via email and Facebook messenger and we have a personal relationship with the director of CBA and a number of it's members. We have been in contact with them via phone, email and Facebook.Finally, I will place the funds in my personal bank account and will use my credit card to pay for the supplies we purchase. As funds are spent, I will update you via GoFundMe on how muchis spent on what items. I will do my best to get reciepts for everything I purchase so that you can see exactly how your money is spent.Please know that your generous donations and hard earned money will be used with the greatest care.

You manage to make a few friends who can offer you only temporary lodging. As an asylum seeker you receive no help from the US government. You might have to wait years until your case is decided. After nine months in the US you receive a work permit and start looking for a job, only to be told that you need previous US work experience in order to find a job. In your home country you were a capable professional with decades of managerial experience. Here that seems to count for little.You’re highly educated, with many marketable skills, US references, and good English. You’re a soft-spoken, unassuming, courageous person with an impressive resume. But without US work experience it could take months for you to find any job. You miss your grown-up children, your country, and the life you built there. Being a homeless exile is hard. To get help from county social-service agencies you must be a county resident. But by definition you’re a resident of nowhere. You must provide proof of income, but you have no income. Your money ran out while you were waiting for the work permit.This is the situation of my new friend, ""Kitty,"" whom I met a few weeks ago at a community meeting. With help from generous neighbors and others I’d never met, I found her a free place to stay and access to local social services. Now Kitty needs help to pay for food, transportation, and living expenses while she looks for work. I’m trying to raise $2,000--four months’ support at $500 per month. She and I will be very grateful for any help you can provide.Please give Kitty the kind of help you’d need if you were in her situation. “You must treat the immigrants who live among you as you treat people born in your land” (Leviticus 19:34).",https://images.gofundme.com/Aa9nTOx8wwvnIdgQwsoLxkLBg4E=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188978_1483559758.0036.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17188978_1483559708.5673_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 4, 2017",Linda Rabben is organizing this fundraiser.,Community & Neighbors,"$2,180 raised of $2,000 goal"

But I'm here to ask for your help, because sometimes you have to ask for help and can't do everything alone. In November of 2006, my father died and in May of 2007, my mom Lynn Fordis was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time. As a newly single mother to three kids (at the time we were 15, 12, and 2) she somehow managed to do it all. She beat cancer, kept a roof over our heads, and managed to provide. To this day, I am incredibly grateful and in complete awe of her strength and determination to raise the three of us. She had a double mastectomy to (hopefully) get rid of everything, but it appears cancer wasn't quite done with her. September 24, 2016 I got a phone call that broke my heart, she found out that she will battle breast cancer for the second time. On Friday, November 4, 2016 she had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer. By the grace of God and amazing family, I was able to be there for her surgery. Shortly after, she found out that she would have to not only do radiation, but chemo as well. Her first chemo treatment was December 14th and her next one was supposed to be today, Wednesday, January 4th at 9:30 AM. She will have two chemo treatments left after the one that was supposed to be today, then she will tackle radiation. Last night she received a phone call from the Cancer Center here in Florida saying that her insurance has changed and she now has a $6,500 deductible, one chemo treatment is $3,000. This is simply too big for us to take on alone. This insurance issue has now pushed back her treatment until we are able to figure something out. She has already started losing her hair after just one treatment. This woman takes every card God has dealt her with such spirit, resilience, and the best possible attitude one can have. She not only provides for Ryan, my 12 year old brother, but is a full time student projected to graduate with me in May 2017.Anyone who knows her knows of her passion for life, her family, and of course the beach.It has taken me hours (and now days) to write this. It's hard to ask for help. It's hard to face things that you simply cannot do on your own. Especially when it's your mom, the only parent you have left, and your best friend. Please send your well wishes, pray for my mom, and if you are able to donate in any financial way please help us during this time.Thank you!Destiny Fordis",https://images.gofundme.com/bnum0ZTZKz5QzNd3WcKdxLODzpk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17189340_1483545953.2511.png,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17189340_1483563209.1383_funddescription.png', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17189340_1483563517.9095_funddescription.jpg']",2,"Created January 4, 2017",Destiny Fordis is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$7,205 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/BruceSzcodronski,Benefit Fund for Bruce Szcodronski,"On February 9th, 2017 we will be hosting a benefit dinner for our father, Bruce Szcodronski. You may know Bruce as the General Manager of the Chelsea Comfort Inn and as a familiar face in the Chelsea community.  In the Fall of 2015 Bruce was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. At that time, he underwent aggressive chemotherapy and radiation as well as extensive surgery to remove his esophagus. The road to recovery has not been easy and, unfortunately, in October we learned that Bruce's cancer has returned. He is currently undergoing experimental chemotherapy infusion 24 hours a day as well as radiation therapy 5 days a week. If you know our father, you won't be surprised that he has continued working full time throughout this entire process. However, due to the intensity of his treatment he has made the difficult decision to resign from his position at the Chelsea Comfort Inn.  Because of his vast medical bills, this will be a huge financial strain on our parents. Throughout his 13 years as the General Manager at the Comfort Inn, Bruce has been actively involved in the Chelsea community. He has volunteered his time at countless community events, been a Chelsea Rotary member for 7 years, and served as the Chelsea Chamber of Commerce president for 3 years before resigning last fall due to his declining health. Given Bruce's dedication to the City of Chelsea, we are hoping that the community will be willing to give back to him in this challenging time. We would like to invite you to attend our event that will be held at the Village Conference Center on February 9th. Cocktail hour will begin at 5:30 PM, followed by dinner and a silent auction. $35 per person. Dinner will be served at 6:30 PM. ***UPDATE***Tickets for dinner have sold out. If you were unable to RSVP for a ticket, please consider still joining us for cocktail hour and silent auction from 5:30-6:30pm to show your support for Bruce. If you unable to attend this event, please consider donating here - 100% of the proceeds will go directly to supporting Bruce's ongoing cancer treatment.  We appreciate anything you can offer and are so grateful for your support.Fondly, Kay, Carly, and Jay Szcodronski",https://images.gofundme.com/aJFKy4ZmyHuxej5dbL7r82vWt3Y=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17189344_14836753300_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Kay Schiller is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Teresa Szcodronski.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$20,425 raised of $20,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/memorial-service-for-andre-lombard,Memorial Service for Andre Lombard,"Andre Lombard (February 1, 1982-December 12, 2016) was my younger brother and only sibling.  Not only did he quickly rise up within his position as an Account Manager at Cal Safety Compliance Corporation in sales of their independent occupational health & safety compliance auditing and reporting products, but he was an incredibly intelligent and talented man who was a living example of overcoming adversity.At his memorial, I intend to tell the tale of his life's story.  Like myself, my brother never got the kinds of opportunities many of us get to have growing up in this country, thanks to our upbringing.  But also like myself, Andre never used it as an excuse to give up before his condition eventually forced him to.  Until then, Andre was my example and my personal hero to keep trying, to keep fighting.  Fighting for justice. Fighting for success.  And, fighting to help one another as fellow human beings.While we didn't have the toughest childhood ever, the things that went on in our household forced us to bond as true brothers.  Having to survive those years together led each other to count on one another for everything.  Like him, I needed someone to trust.  And for 2/3rds of my life, Andre was the only person in my life I trusted completely.  And even though his conditioned took away his personality, and ultimately, took my brother away from me before the 2010s, I always thought of him as my brother-in-arms, my fellow soldier in arms.  Because only he and I ever really knew what went on then.  Only Andre and I would ever tell the truth about everything. And in spite of our growing differences as adults, he never stopped believing in the same values.His strength and courage was indominable and I don't think my brother ever believed how much it inspired me to be better than the best, because in many ways, in everything I've always done and ever did, Andre was better than me.  It is impossible to deny the heartbreak now that I face in the wake of realizing I will Never hear his voice again.  His perspective.  What is on his mind.  The nature of Andre's outlook on life that always made me want to think, learn and grow.Today, I want to share Andre's legacy.  He didn't have much time to truly show his full potential, but what he did for me and for every friend he ever made in his world along the way, it mattered.  Andre counted for something and I want to make sure that he is properly remembered, and that his one loyal family member is able to honor his memory with all of the respect and dignity he deserves.The funds are needed for covering costs associated with the services of Angeleno Valley Mortuary and the Los Angeles County Coroner's office.We hope to have this campaign fully fundeded as soon as possible as we have no indication that my brother had any policies that might have included a death benefit.  Once we know when (or if) there will be a memorial, we will send out the appropriate invitations.I will be managing final expenses.",https://images.gofundme.com/yuyqpHjvKaPnzPmJwpxdeasfaQs=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17189364_1483545197.5827.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Dairenn Lombard is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$2,725 raised"

Leo knew he had to wake Brittany up, and didn't stop barking and jumping on her until she was able to wake up and call the fire department.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/street-dogs-of-puerto-rico,Street Dogs of Puerto Rico,"I travel to Puerto Rico a couple of times a year.  I have started trying to spay/neuter dogs and cats and have tried to find homes for several dogs and cats.  I have been doing this with my own money and with the econmy failing down there many more animals are being dumped to starve in the streets.I am working with a group who will allows me to pay $35/dog and $45/cat to spay and neuter the street animals.  Many rescues work with people down there to spay, neuter and vacinate their animals, and to tell you the truth, many of these people have the money to do it but just don't think their pets are worth it.  Sadly the street dogs, who have been someone's pet and dumped and the feral ones who are just born, litter after litter from dogs who originated in the street are overlooked.  I am all about the street animals.  Many of them are friendly and will allow us humans to help them.  The ferals won't but at least we can feed them so they are not hungry and put medications in their food to help them be more comfortable.  I had a female taken to the vet to be spayed as she already had puppies and homes were found for them.  She lives among 5 males and will become pregnant again soon.  Well she is sickly and is being treated just so she is in healthy enough shape to be spayed and still live in the street.  I have a friend who feeds these dogs and cats every day for 6 hours a day- on her lunch break, after work and before she goes to bed.Another female who had puppies had her puppies taken from her from a restaurant owner so more dogs would not be in that area.  I am sure he either dumped them somewhere else with no food source or killed them.  All this mama did was move her puppies from a wet area to near the restaurant and puff they are gone.  Another dog moved her puppes away from people and put under a bridge.  Well the rains came and the water came up and the puppies drowned.   I would like to have this female spayed and am sure she will need medical treatment first before she can be done.I have been told that some people who live in PR are getting funding and not helping the animals.  One dog who I met this last trip, who was fine when I left, was hit by a car and has problems with his jaw.  He is in pain day in and day out and NOBODY cares.  Well I do and am trying to get someone there to help him.  He needs to eat and should not be in pain.Read about the street stray dogs of PR.  If you go onto Island Dog's page and hit donate you will see a photo of a mama dog nursing her babies.  That is a feral dog I tried for 1.5 years to catch.  Those babies in the photo are all safe.  Sadly she had another litter and I was only able to catch two of them.  They were sent to Pets Alive PR and have homes now.  Out of the 4 remaining one one lives as a feral giving birth to litter after litter to feral dogs who will never have a chance because they fear humans.So any donation would help me to try and do what I can for these animals.  Look at your dog and cat and be happy they live with you and not on the streets begging for food or are at the hands of stupid people who like to hurt them.  If more money is raised more lives can be saved.  Thank you",https://images.gofundme.com/IBD_FtjUXwE_0kQ6XMSpfyoDcb0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190062_1483548848.7198.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Debbie Chiapperino is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$1,840 raised of $2,000 goal"

This is my story:  I have two grade one tumours in my left breast. One of them measures 2.1cm x 1.7cm the other is 1 cm. I found it on 3 Dec in the morning dancing naked shaking my tits (not on purpose they just shake) in the mirror because I thought I'd lost weight. Wasn't quite the result I'd had in mind. I went to the doctors on 5th Dec and had the first hospital appointment on Dec 19th, mammogram on Dec 22nd with initial findings and full diagnosis on Dec 29th It was confirmed that I had breast cancer!  On paper I should be last person to get 'cancer', I eat a clean, orgnaic diet, I don't uae pharmaceutical products, I use bicarb as deodorant and so on...but I am 100% sure that my cancer is emotional...I've been dealt some really shit hands in my 36 years, but that's all in the past and I'd really like to show the Big C the Big Fuck off door and get rid of him naturally and pronto! Now let's be really clear here, I do not want your sympathy or your 'I'm so sorry s' whilst these tumours have decided to take up residency in one of my humble, albeit slightly droopy tits, they have left some other person alone! *coughs, thanks ever so much Mr C*  Now the money bit: My treatment through the NHS will cost a minimum of 30k. But I want to do this as natural as possible and that's where I need your help.  I need to get vitamin C drips, suppliments, a water distiller, thermo imaging to check tumour shrinkage, hormone testing reports, and generally taking the weight off my shoulders financially as my regular job was night work and that meant not sleeping properly so I've had to give it up while I kick start healing and get as much rest as I can. id really love to get 'Shake your tits' trending as we should all be shaking, massaging, feeling our way around to spot any changes in our breasts as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your kind donations, I know this will be one debt I will never be able to repay you all, but I promise to beat this little fucker!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/donatedala,Dry Season in Dala,"In 2008, Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was hit by cyclone Nargis, the worst natural catastrophe in country’s history, claiming about 138,000 lives. Dala, a township near the city of Yangon, has been stricken by poverty ever since that day of tragedy. Even though there have been great waves of voluntary help, Dala and its people have not been able to recover. Every day, both adults and their children have to fight for basic human needs such as clean drinking water and food to survive in the ruins of what used to be their town. The average disposable income in Dala is around 0.18p per day. While clean water is almost unheard of (would have to be individually purchased in bottles), water that is being used for drinking is not only dirty, but contaminated with salt. Because locals have little knowledge about the deadly consequences of this water, these available bottles are exchanged for food instead of consumed. At the moment, Dala is closing in on starting their dry season. Then they will not be able to gather rain water from the local lake or from their rusty rooftops. During this time, more contaminated water is drank, as it has deadly consequences for children, who could die from diarrhea, cholera or typhoid from drinking the contaminated water. Dala estimates to house about 200 children. With your help, our Enactus team, along with some volunteers, are dedicated to attack this desperate need of food and water before the dry season. With your generous help and donations, our team will install a reverse osmosis water system, helping about 100 families daily. However, we won’t stop there! Thanks to this new system we will construct our Aquaponics system which makes it possible to use “waste” water from the system into producing agricultural food for the people in the community.We are Coker Enactus, a nonprofit student organization always trying to make a difference! Even though we are located in South Carolina, we believe that we can make an impact on the other side of the world. We are raising money for the township of Dala in Myanmar to build a reverse osmosis water filtration system. Articles:MyanmarTimes - Dala residents face dwindling water supplies Eleven Myanmar - Dala Township residents request water donations Xinhuanet - Myanmar residents face water shortage during dry season Get to know us!https://www.facebook.com/CokerEnactus/?fref=ts",https://images.gofundme.com/6eLWQFdJAgqfgMfRCjiFFFop070=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jge8flrDZUo/0.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190250_1483881695.1172_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190250_1483881723.647_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190250_1483881750.796_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190250_1483881787.1687_funddescription.jpg']",4,"Created January 8, 2017",Zane Vanhook is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Gabriel Mens.,Volunteer & Service,"$12,240 raised"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/HenryButler,Henry Butler Cancer Treatment,"Henry Butler, the renowned New Orleans pianist and singer, has recently been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Henry is blind and lives mostly in New York City, We are trying to raise a minimum 35K as quickly as possible to send him to Germany for special care where he can receive hyperthermia treatment from a renown doctor and have the around-the-clock supervised medical care he needs. The money will also be used to get him the extra help he will need for the duration of treatment and recovery. The doctor feels optimistic that he can eliminate Henry's cancer using mainly thermotherapy, a treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures (up to 113°F). Research has shown that high temperatures can damage and kill cancer cells, usually with minimal injury to normal tissues. This may also be used in conjunction with more traditional radiation and chemotherapy. You can read about thermotherapy here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia_therapyHaving been blinded by glaucoma in infancy, Henry has been playing the piano since he was six years old, and arranging, composing, and performing professionally since he was twelve. He has enjoyed a remarkable career as a premier exponent of the great New Orleans jazz and blues piano tradition. Once you’ve heard what Henry's hands can create on the ivories, there’s no going back. Those hands boogie the keyboard like no one else’s. Throw in a classically trained voice aching through the blues, and you’re someplace you have never been before. And you will want to go back there. Again and again.Henry is not only a national musical treasure, but a wise and spiritual human being.  We are hoping that between Henry's fan base and his stature in the music community, we can reach our target of 35K and get him treated by February. Many musicians whom we know are giving $50. If 700 people did just that, he would reach his goal. Perhaps some of you can donate much more. Perhaps some of you can donate less. But anything you can give to help Henry beat this cancer will so deeply appreciated both by Henry, and by the musical communities of New York City, New Orleans, and beyond.He has many concerts coming up this spring and summer in the US and Europe and he is committed and hoping to continue performing for his fans old and new.",https://images.gofundme.com/ld4V66EQX1WTFSM3992JqxZiWro=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190288_1483548065.7751.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190288_1484235867.1173_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 12, 2017",Richard Julian is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Henry Butler.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$55,134 raised of $35,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/je-suis-camille,Camille Strong,"At 12:15 AM on Saturday, December 17, 2016, Camille Moffat was driving on Beck Street in Bountiful, UT, when she was hit head-on by a drunk driver. Camille suffered severe physical injuries and serious brain trauma. She was life-flighted to Intermountain Medical Center where she received immediate emergency medical attention and has spent the subsequent weeks in the Shock Trauma Intensive Care Unit. Camille has undergone multiple surgeries and is slowly walking the road to recovery. She has daily physical and occupational therapy, but remains bedridden, and will likely be unable to walk for at least 6 months. Her recovery will take at least a year. The outpouring of support for Camille Moffat following her accident has included requests to contribute funds to help in the care of Camille. In speaking with Camille's parents, it seems that much of the cost for Camille's care should be covered by insurance and (ir)responsible third-parties. Some costs, however, may ""fall outside the definition of insured, compensatory, and/or punitive"". The Moffats have agreed with our request to establish a GoFundMe account to assist with Camille's care but in doing so they indicated that the most meaningful contributions will be prayers, visits, telephone calls, Skype sessions, and companionship (including trips to museums and nights at the opera). Further, the Moffats indicated that funds will not be used in any way that would compromise the obligations of those responsible for Camille's condition. Finally, any excess funds will be used to host a Christmas 2017 Gala for Camille to celebrate her accomplishments through that date and to provide all who can attend with an opportunity to draw a breath and humbly celebrate a year of tender mercies.",https://images.gofundme.com/WlMJ2N3xmGOOfru6p6sYPOIG494=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190342_1483548062.3921.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Heather Butikofer is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of David Moffat.,Other,"$4,690 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/trinidad-mission-trip,Trinidad Mission Trip,"Greetings! Hi, I’m Joseph, a junior in highschool and between March 11-18, I and other members of Denton Bible Church will participate in a mission trip in Trinidad, an island in the West Indies located 7 miles off the coast of Venezuela. While there, we will be working with Trinidad and Tobago Ministries (TTUM.org) to serve the local population. In parks, street corners, schools, and other places, we’ll be sharing the gospel by performing a drama designed to spark intellectual conversation about the good news. Besides the performance, we’ll also be serving local churches, leading backyard Bible clubs, and helping with construction projects.Traveling to Trinidad, for me, is a rare opportunity to serve people in the less-developed areas of the world as well as fulfill Jesus’s Great Commision: to “go and make disciples of all nations.” By spreading God’s love to people in different countries, we foster religious growth and spiritual awakening in populations all over the world. More than 20% of Trinidadian citizens live below the poverty line, thus, providing desperately-needed assistance to underprivileged members of society helps them cope with the day-to-day struggles some face due to lack of basic necessities such as shelter.In order for this project to take place, we have two needs that must be met: Prayer and Financial Support. For many students, including myself, this will be our first mission trip, so pray that we will all have the courage to talk to others about Christianity while serving them with patience and selflessness. I also ask of you to please pray for the safety of our group, whether it be between flight or during our stay in Trinidad. Lasty, for each member to participate in this trip, $1900 is needed, much of which comes from individual fundraising efforts such as this letter you’re currently reading. Each team member is responsible for raising gifts to Denton Bible Church in this amount.  If you feel called to financially partner with us, we would be very grateful for any donation of any amount on your behalf.  Contributions are made with the understanding that Denton Bible Church has complete control and discretion over the use of any donated funds. Any monies given in excess of required cost of this trip will be used for short-term mission trips.  Thank you so much for your consideration in partnering with us on this trip. Any support, whether it is through financial aid or prayer (or both), is always very appreciated by all of us.                                          Best wishes,                                                    Joseph LeeMatthew 28:19-20 ""Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.

She showed us what it meant to be truly oneself.Quincy loved to dance, play with pinwheels, drive in her fancy ""Quincy Bus"", and wrestle with her brothers and sister. She loved Rihanna, getting scared, and giving us her ""teacher face.""While she was reliant on so many others for so much, Quincy gave more than she took and everyone who met her was truly better for it.We are heart-broken right now, but I am grateful that Quincy was given to us and for her part in our family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/service-to-haiti,Service to Haiti,"Hello everyone! My name is Jessica Nkechi Nwabeke and I am currently a third year student at the University of Houston. Global outreach through healthcare has always been a passion of mine. I was given a reminder of this during a family trip back to Nigeria in 2012. During our stay, my family and I hosted our own community health fair right in my father's village. It was here that I came to fully understand the saying ""It takes a village"". With the help of both my immediate and extended family, we were able to administer basic health care treatment and supplies to the many people who stopped by. I was also able to assist both the physicians and nurses with basic level tasks while observing their methods of patient care.  This summer, May 19-28, I will be traveling to Haiti with Friends of Haiti (FOH). FOH is an organization that is based in Houston, Texas at the University of Houston. They have been operating for the past three years, traveling to Haiti with a group of students and medical professionals to set up mobile clinics and work on sustainability projects. As a volunteer with FOH, I will prep, work and shadow at a few medical clinics in Lilavois, Port-au-Prince and other local clinics. I will also have the opportunity to attend MD and RN panels, teach kids, participate in a permaculture project, work with Missionary of Charity to educate individuals on various health topics and feed infants. I will also visit Lifeline for an education lesson. Although this organization will kindly cover the cost of in-country expenses, I am kindly asking for your donation to be able to experience all of the things mentioned above.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/bald-eagle-preservation-documentary,Bald Eagle Preservation Documentary,"Since the bald eagle was removed from the Endangered Species list in 2007, it has still suffered great losses through habitat depletion and poisoning by toxic substances. There have also been many uncharged violations of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA). The Protection Act was put in place in 1940 to offer the birds greater protections because of their status as our National Symbol.In April 2015, a nest still frequented by eagles was removed in Virginia Beach for a $30 million commercial and residential development project. In January 2016, a new homeowner, also in Virginia Beach, ordered a tree service to cut down a tree containing an active nest to the horror of onlooking neighbors. No fines or jail time were imposed.In July of 2016, a developer built two large warehouses in Manassas, Virginia, within four feet of an active nest. They violated the August 1 start date (end of nesting season) as early as April with soil sampling that forced the two adult eagles to temporarily abandon their eaglets. No permits, buffers, signs, or any protections were allotted to the eagles during the course of the entire construction project. Now they must attempt to successfully breed and raise young with large trucks loading and unloading just twenty feet away.Even in Eagle, Idaho, named after our Nation’s bird, a conservation group is struggling to protect an active nest from developers. This is happening in towns all across our great nation.“Who’s Protecting Our National Bird?” will place a bright spotlight on the challenges still facing our Nation's Bird. Though bald eagles have had a comeback since the insecticide DDT was banned in 1972, their populations have only grown to about one-tenth of the more than 500,000 birds estimated to have called North America home in the 1700s. Because it is our National Bird—a symbol used on money, on our military emblems, and in many businesses (including our U.S. Postal Service)—we believe protections must be increased, and enforced, until we have reached a more sustainable and noticeable population. Many Americans have never seen a bald eagle in the wild.Your contributions will help cover travel costs, production, music licensing, editing, and more to make this quality film, which will be produced by Telly award-winning filmmaker, Victor Rook.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/barbaratahhanpetrella,Help Barbara Fight Leukemia,"Many of you know my mom, Barbara, for her kind and loving personality. This is why she holds a special place in so many hearts. As most of you now know she was recently diagnosed with Leukemia. Since then she has been in and out of the hospital receiving costly blood transfusions on an almost weekly basis. With the help of her doctor at Dana Farber, we have now decided to move forward in her treatment plan with a Stem Cell transplant. Once she returns home after this, her immune system will be very, very weak and she will have a recovery period of one year. During this time she will be unable to work. My dad was planning on taking a lot of time off from work during her treatment and recovery, but is now unexpectedly out of work himself for 12 weeks, after having surgery to repair his torn rotator cuff. As if these medical bills weren’t a huge burden on their own upon my mom’s return home, my dad and I will have to clean out our whole home. Due to my mom’s nonexistent immune system, we have to clear out all of our furniture, rugs, clothes, and many household item and replace them. She needs to have an extremely new and clean environment to ensure she doesn't get sick. She will be housebound for an entire year post transplant, other than doctors appointments and eventually, occasional short walks. We also have to find somewhere for our beloved family cat to live for the year, as my mom can not be around an animal that goes outdoors. He is very stubborn and high maintenance. He has lived his whole life in my neighborhood, and will not do well in a new environment. He also does not like to be indoors. This has been so extremely hard on each of us. We are also looking in this short period of time to build him an insulated home in our backyard. If anyone is able to help with this in anyway, it would be greatly appreciated. All suggestions are welcomed. As you can imagine this is essentially like moving out of your home, throwing everything away, and re-purchasing newer versions of everything. This has already proven to be a huge, stressful, and tiring process on top of everything else going on.My mom is a very strong, independent, and determined woman, who would never ask for help. Because of this, I wanted to create a GoFundMe for all of our friends and family who have asked for a way to help. All of the donations will go directly towards medical bills and creating my mom a safe space to remain in her best possible health.We are beyond grateful for any contributions, but we also urge you to give blood to the Red Cross (which you can do in my moms name, Barbara Tahhan Petrella) or sign up to be a donor.

For me, it's the day I found out my wife, Ferzana Khan (41) has cancer. We have been married for 21 years, and have 4 children, the youngest is 5. She is a selfless individual that smiles no matter how much pain she is going through, she is our pillar and our family would collapse without her .. My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, she immediately started treatment which included a mastectomy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. The treatments were unsuccessful and the cancer had spread to the lower back. Our whole lives got turned upside down, we tried everything, we began a lifestyle and diet change but the cancer continued to spread.It's come to the point now where she cannot even stand up and do basic things. I quit my jobs and now care for her and the children full time. Life has become difficult... But I believe that after every difficulty there's hope and ease, with countless hours of research, the only treatment option available now is immunotherapy to save not just her life, but our whole families. Due to her weakened state she is not currently eligible to join a U.K. immunotherapy trial. So I have made the decision to travel to Germany for private treatment but the cost is not something we can afford. Creating this page for me is one of the hardest things I have had to write. My heart is poured out and we need your help and support. We are relying on you to give anything you can, no matter how small and if you can't give, then please, it costs nothing to share this page, please.

Basketball and football players come from places that rank lower than average on those same indicators.  Statistics show that communities with lower incomes are predominantly ""poorer Americans"".   This could directly correspond as to why less minority youth are playing the sport of soccer.   Here in Charleston, SC my goal is to bridge this gap and get more children out on the soccer field being successful and developing a passion for the game.   Every child deserves an equal opportunity.       The major problem is the financial aspect of playing soccer under USYS (United States Youth Soccer).  The expenses per year can rack up over a $1,000.00 between registration fees each season (two a year), uniforms, and tournaments.  This excludes the equipment needed to even play.          In addition, I want children in Charleston in this program to be coached by licensed USSF coaches and have their fees, uniforms and tournaments paid for.  These coaches have to go through safety, technical, and tactical training to obtain these certifications.  When children play, they deserve to have the best coaching experience possible, and be educated at a high level.           Players will also be part of a mentoring program after school and before practice.  Here they will get the academic support they need and learn to be better citizens.  This mentorship program is something I am extremely passionate about.  I want to see more students becoming successful in the classroom and playing this beautiful game at a high level when they are older, without having to deal with the financial burdens.",https://images.gofundme.com/S55RP7C5_icY3_IdLKJoMYD9O6g=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17190902_1483549618.6366.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Chris James is organizing this fundraiser.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$3,095 raised of $5,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/Nicks-UT-attendance-costs,Nick's Back to School Fund,"In the Fall of 2011, I began my first semester at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin)  pursuing a B.S. in Biochemistry. In the fall of 2012, I had a seizure which caused complete memory loss, leaving me to relearn everything I had ever known and being subjected to multiple health exams, all while remaining enrolled at UT Austin. I thought with hard work I’d be able to recover and pass my classes with no problem, however, I quickly found that was not the case at all. I withdrew at the end of the fall 2012 semester to account for missed classes/exams and lost credit. I tried to continue my education in the Spring of 2013. Over the next few years, I had many pitfalls as I struggled with memory loss, something I still do to this day. The memory problems lead to a loss of understanding of the basics needed for most of my courses. While some professors were willing to work with me, others were unwavering and left me to bridge the gap between what I could remember and what I was learning. I found myself doing well in the courses where my professors were able to be of help, but with no full support and more classes than average to maintain my graduation plan, my ability to continue in school was affected. From 2013 I was successful with 54 credits. Using the accommodations from the Student Disability services office my course load was reduced for a good amount of this time. It allowed for a slow more thorough recovery from the memory loss. Ultimately it wasn’t something that was able to help with the mental health issues I didn’t know were underneath the surface. Not only did I face physical health problems due to my epilepsy, but I faced mental health issues that remained undiagnosed until my first suicide attempt in June of 2016. After this diagnosed I was referred to an IOP group to help me process through the things since 2012. After the seizure, I was faced with the loss of my family in a complete state through my parents' divorce. During the divorce, I lost a connection with my sister, my father, and my mother. I attempted to fill this gap with school work, my jobs, and my community. While I found love and support from peers, advisors, and educators, my mental health was declining to the point that I could no longer function at the capacity of what was required for my degree or to pay for my education. Towards the end of the first run at getting my degree, I was losing my financial aid and was finding it difficult and ultimately impossible to pay for the schooling. In Spring 2017 I lost my financial aid due and the two jobs I had to try to help pay for food and basic necessities. This caused me to heavily rely on free food on campus. As you can imagine this added to my stress to graduate. By the end of the 2017 spring semester, I was forced to take time off from the university. At the time I neither had the money nor the means to provide for myself basic necessities for living, let alone the ability to pay off a $10,000 debt to the university that needed to be paid before I could enroll for the following semester. Being out of school from the summer of 2017 to this point has allowed me to recover to an extent. It still left me depressed and with more anxiety than I knew what to do with. In August I attempted suicide once more, this time I went to a more fitting IOP that helped to help me build the necessary and healthy coping skills that I had forgotten over the course of the past 6 years. I now have a regular psychiatrist and therapist who actually listen to me and help meet my needs and provide me with even more help to pull me even further out and keep me from falling back into my depression. Let me tell you it’s working too. As a result, I’ve begun to reconnect with my family and build relationships with people who have been left at the wayside for far too long. The most fulfilling things have been teaching my younger cousins in all things school and life. I’ve been working and saving to be able to pay the debt I owe to the university. It hasn’t been easy and has actually proved to be close to impossible, however, I am determined to graduate. As of December 1st, I have applied for admission to the University of Texas at Austin to finish my degree. I started in Biochemistry and will be finishing in Chemistry after multiple discussions with my advisors. I will be adding a teaching certificate to my degree in order to help other students who need that same help I’ve needed and helped me find a path to having that “Dr.” in front of my name, to achieve my dreams. I plan to finish my courses between the Spring semester of 2019 to the end of the Spring of 2020. I have planned all my courses for the next year and a half. I will also be re-registering with the Students with disabilities office to allow for the accommodations that I may need due to my epilepsy, but adding those for my anxiety and depression. During the semester I will be working at Kerbey Lane to pay for courses and any other necessary things for school since I no longer have financial aid. Currently, the only thing standing in my way is the debt to UT. I owe a $500 emergency loan, $4,500 Tuition loan, and roughly $5,000 to Housing. I’ve been ashamed and too prideful to ask for help for many things in my life, but if I’m ever going to achieve my dreams of pursuing a career in genetics to focus on genetic diseases then I must put those things aside and ask for the help I need.

Over the holidays my boyfriend Alex and I found a random lump on our pups belly, Kaya. She is our sweet 2 year old Staffy Mix who we adopted as a puppy.  Her mother was recused from a kill shelter, and made her way to PA. Kaya is one of the miracle pups that made it, so we were beyond excited to adopt her.  Kaya is a perfect little thing who loves to run, play, swim, climb..anything adventurous. She is our little bed-warmer, she sleeps snuggeled in between her mom and dad every night. She really loves her ""pack"". Kaya is the sweestest girl and an important part of our family!We just spoke with the vet and found out the lump is cancerous and we need to get it removed. Of course this includes ultrasounds, blood work, anesesia, medication and of course the surgery. Kayas ultrasound is happening first, to find out if there are more tumors internally. We also need to get her current tumor removed before it gets bigger or spreads. A rash is starting to form over the mass, which the doctor said is common for the type she has.  He even has concerns of its spreading to her internal organs, based on the type of tumor she has. The vets we spoke with do not offer payment plans so we are unsure how we can come up with the funds becuase we need to take care of this quickly.Alex and I live very simple lifes. As yoga instructores, we dont make much, but we are able to have a comfortable home and live simple and happy lives. We love our job and the ability to help people on a daily basis. So today, we ask for some help in return, so we can afford to help our doggie daughter live a full life! A small donation will help us immensely. Kaya may be a dog, but to us she is our daughter.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/wheelchair-ramp-for-mama-bear,Wheelchair Ramp for Mama Bear,"I know that everyone thinks their mother is the most amazing mother on the plant, but ours really is.Growing up our mom instilled in us several virtues that I credit to any success that I have had in my life. She taught us that you have to work really hard and never give up on your goals and dreams. She taught us that family is one of the most important things in this life. She also taught us to be compassionate and live with love in our hearts. To show compassion to those less fortunate and to never judge a book by its cover because you never know the journey it has traveled.In 1994 our mom was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and our lives changed forever. For those of you that are not familiar with MS, it is a progressive disease that attacks the central nervous system. While it impacts everyone to different levels of severity, most everyone suffers from severe fatigue, muscle pains, numbness, and disorientation. It eventually causes its victims to lose the ability to walk and function in a “normal” capacity.For over 20 years our mom has fought this disease because she refuses to let this beat her. She was able to work a challenging job in the pediatric healthcare industry until a few years ago when she lost feeling in her both of her feet and right leg. She started literally walking out of her shoes because she couldn’t feel that they were no longer there. The cane came next to give her more stability and balance. Then she did the one thing that we weren’t prepared for…. she quit her job and went on disability.As the last few years have passed, her MS has progressed. While she is not wheelchair bound yet, we all know that day is coming sooner rather than later. Our mom still lives in the house that we grew up in. With the same front stairs and back deck that we played on as kids. Many of the boards are rotting and in crucial need of replacement. Today we ask that you donate to this Go-Fund Me account to help us install ramps to the front and back stairs of her home.  If you have ever met my mother, you know that she will never ask for help. SHE is always the one offering support and love to those around her. We think it is time for us all to get together and show her how much she has impacted and improved our lives. If you don’t have money to donate towards building materials, no problem! We welcome you to volunteer your time as well!

Well I was accepted into her 6-week program last November and I've already felt a transformation into a better performer. Dana is one of the biggest choreographer's in the industry, working with Beyonce, Janet Jackson and JLO to name a few.

Try to imagine how big of a deal this is for me! This 10 week program is $4,000 which is a big goal to reach, but I see it as investment towards this dream I've been chasing and training so hard for literally my whole life and now that I'm standing at this open door, I need a little help to put that foot through! So all I ask is $1, thats all (or if you're feeling nice and generous..!)

I had a rough start to my life as a feral dog, where I was abused and neglected. Then, when I was one, my parents adopted me. I wasn't so sure about the people world, but I quickly adjusted to being a family pet. Now I am a goofy and well-behaved girl. My parents thought they were prepared for anything, and always had an emergency fund put away in case anything happened to me. I have never needed to use it, until now! I need life-saving lung surgery. On Thursday, December 28th, I started acting a little weird. I had scratched my eye playing with my friends, so the vet gave me eye drops. My eye felt better, but I was still sick. I went back to the vet on Friday for some blood work. It was normal, so nobody seemed too worried. I started to cough a little on Saturday. My mom called the vet, and it didn't seem too serious. We made an appointment for Tuesday. Then, I got really sick. I started wheezing and gagging. My pee was really dark red. My lungs sounded wet. I was scared! Sunday night, I had to see the emergency vet. I stayed overnight for two nights with IV fluids and antibiotics. Everybody hoped it was just pneumonia because my left lung looked fluid-filled on X-ray. I got to go home, but I didn't feel better. January 4th, I started coughing up blood. I am going to see the specialist in Calgary. They think my lung has twisted (lung torsion), and if I don't have surgery I will die. The chances of recovery after surgery are really good! The surgery alone will be around $10,000, but I would get to have a long and happy life. Please consider a small donation toward my medical care. This is a rare emergency that nobody could have predicted. It is hard to ask for help, and I am grateful for your generosity. Thank you! Love, Lucy***UPDATE***Specialist vets confirmed a left lung torsion - a true emergency. Lucy had her surgery the morning of January 5th.

I campaigned on such issues as keeping the classroom clean, fundraising to purchase things for the classroom (like a new smartboard) and raising money for charity. My opponents campaigned on such issues as bringing back snack time, less homework and getting a class pet.On election day, the voters spoke...and they went with the Hamster.Although I learned a valuable lesson about politics, and  actually like Giblet the Hamster, I was still upset I didn't win. Plus, we still need a new smartboard. So instead of whining that I didn't win, I decided to turn a negative situation into a positive, and attempt to raise funds for a new Interactive Smartboard for my classroom here on GoFundMe.com. This would mean a lot to me, as well as my classmates, and we would be thankful for any donation you could make.Have a Happy & Healthy New Year!  God Bless!Lorenzo",https://images.gofundme.com/oY5QFKo4WTGHgn6TAQPO7pKGb8o=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17191738_1483722959.3237.png,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",L G is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$1,876 raised of $2,000 goal"

She has been fitted for a brace and is resting comfortably in the hospital.  Riise should be going home to her parents' house in the next day or two, where they will help care for her.Riise is facing uncertain medical costs, which will not be entirely covered by her insurance (ambulances, ER visit, hospital stay, etc.) The value of her car is a total loss. She also has unexpected housing expenses due to a roommate  moving out. It is uncertain how long she will be unable to work, drive, etc. On top of suffering a  traumatic accident, Riise is very concerned about these daunting financial issues.Just a few years out of college, Riise is currently a bakery manager in training in St. Paul, Minnesota.

How about lazy, stupid or dumb.There was a saying I would hear lot when I was a kid. “Sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt you”. Words will never hurt in less of course you believe them. If you believe those words like, lazy, stupid, and dumb then that's exactly what you become. If you are told that you’re stupid because you can't memorize the alphabet enough times, that's exactly what you start to believe, that you're stupid because you can't memorize the alphabet like everyone else can.I know how that feels to be called stupid, lazy, dumb and worse. I know how it feels to be that kid that nobody understood, to be that kid that nobody wanted to be around.

I will also need a publicist to guide me through all the ins and outs of this process. That is why I need to raise money so I can fund the editing, publishing and distribution of this book.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/feral-cat-colony-rescue-expenses,Feral Cat Colony Rescue Expenses,"I am Julie Skene, a cat lover and here is my story... On March 3rd, 2016, my best buddy, Harold Shaw, a 100% disabled, Native American Vet passed away suddenly, leaving an unattended feral cat colony next to his delapidated little shack, on an abandoned street in an idustrial area of Pontiac. I knew I immediately had to take over caring for the kitties. You see, once you start feeding a colony - you can't stop until thay all either die off or move on. There is no wildlife for them to eat and nowhere for them to go. I used to tell my buddy to catch them and get them fixed, but he never did and the colony REALLY multiplied over the years. He loved these little guys so much that he built them a heated kitty condo on the side of his house, piping up heat from his boiler through a basement window. But now, the house is abondoned. It was purchased, but nothing has been done to fix it up and there is no heat, electricity or water. My buddy also spoiled these kitties by giving them steak... All this from a big tough guy who claimed ""They're just cats.""  To date at least 12 cats have been rescued, rehabilitated and adopted. But there are many more to go and I have to tell you - it is breaking the bank... Two kittens and one adult have died unfortunately. Over all, the colony is pretty healthy (Feline Herpes & round worm) and pretty darn affectionate. I have gotten to know them intimately - thay all have names and actuallu know them. Initially, I contacted more than five cat rescues for help, only to get rejected. ""Sorry - we are overflowing with cats."" ""No time to work with ferals."" No - we can't help with food, cages, or capturing them."" The responses go on and on. So - it was all up to me. I even got certified in Trap & Release, but guess what? You have to release them back to where you found them and there is nothing... So, I befriend them, get them talking, pet tham and then I scruff them, put them in a carrier and bring them to my ""Cat Fostering Room"" for usually about two months. I get them communicating, I smother them with affection - petting, brushing, even massages and I teach them how to play. I use toys that remind them of birds, mice & snakes. I make sure if they are sick that they get treated for those things 1st. Then it is all the shots and last spay/neuter. Some of these little ones have cost me over $1000! So, I have expenses for both those still at the colony and those that go through my fostering program. My friends affectionately call me ""The Kitty Keeper."" My car now has a plate holder that says ""Kitty Mobile."" I am living cats night and day. Did I mention I have 3 special needs cats of my own that are also VERY expensive? The colony gets visited everyday in the afternoon for mealtime - 2 large cans of soft food, one small, 4 cups of dry food, fresh water (1 gallon jug/wk.), Lysine mixed with their soft food to build up their immune systems.  (I have a full time job by the way.) The cats have two velcro, waterproof houses with straw and reflective insulation and two huge styrofoam insulated shelters that I made. The cats in the fostering room have it a little better - 2 meals/day, twice the Lysine, pet beds and a HUGE jungle-like piece of cat furniture, to remind them of their home and I spend time with them at least 4 times/day. So, I have my hands full - cat food, soft & dry, jugs of water, cat litter, towels, blankets, cat beds, toys,                                                                                                                 food bowels, Lysine, Probiotics, vet bills, cat furniture - even gas mileage to and from the colony. I estimate that since March, all of this has cost me about $6,000. So, I could REALLY use any financial support I can get and would sincerely appreciate it. I am in this for the long haul, until I have nabbed every last one of these little guys and found them a good home.",https://images.gofundme.com/RypWgbC3nSRCFDb-MNNolxTllpM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17191914_1561325697187577_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Julie Skene is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$1,215 raised of $5,000 goal"

He does a phenomenal job of taking care of himself, works closely with his doctors, and uses his great sense of humor to keep a positive attitude. But some things he just can't control.Diabetes is tough. For Sean, his blood sugar can quickly skyrocket making him extremely ill, or drop to life-threatening levels in a matter of minutes. To manage this, he requires 4-5 insulin injections a day, with an additional 4-5 daily blood tests just to stay healthy. The most dangerous complication of Type 1 Diabetes is acute hypoglycemia, otherwise known as low blood sugar. While most of the time this can be easily corrected as soon as he feels the symptoms, this condition can have a devastating impact if Sean is sleeping or too sick to get help. It could leave him in a coma or possibly take his life.Because of this, it's been impossible for Sean, a 30-year old single father of one, to ever live by himself. This spring, Sean needs to find a place of his own. With no roommate and his family 1,000 miles away, a night-time low-blood sugar event could be catastrophic. So now, after living with family and a series of roommates all his life, we want to safely enable him to be completely independent with the help of a Diabetes Alert Dog.In a nutshell, these dogs are trained to alert their owners when their blood sugar is too low or too high, even if it means waking them up in the middle of the night.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jake-the-snake-bite-victim,Help Jake the Snake Bite Victim,"Jake was bitten by a Mozambique Spitting Cobra in Zululand South Africa while he was asleep at a friend’s house. He was admitted to a state hospital in the early hours on the 16th of December 2016.  Due to the limited resources the facility had available combined with the excess strain the facility was under during the festive season, Jake was discharged without receiving the full treatment required and has experienced further trauma.  After discharge it became apparent that further medical intervention was essential immediately.  At this point Jake was transferred to a private facility under the guidance of a specialist surgeon. To date he has undergone two surgical procedures, with more to follow in the near future. Unfortunately due to the fact that he is solely supported by a single mother Jake is not insured for the treatment he is receiving. His single mother has extremely limited resources with two other children to support and has already stretched beyond her means to facilitate the essential two private surgical procedures he has already gone through.  His next surgery will take place in the next 48 hours, the immediate funds required are already outstanding costs demanded by the medical facilities and practitioners, and already overwhelm any resources that Jake’s mother has available. This treatment that Jake will be receiving is not a short term requirement and it is expected that it will take several months of ongoing procedures under professional care.  On behalf of this young boy we would like to ask for any assistance that could be made available to help relieve the financial burden that is upon this young family. We would like to note that Jake is a nature lover with an ambition to find a future working with wildlife and he is aware that he was not attacked by this snake. This was an unfortunate turn of events that requires more support than his small family unit is able to provide. Please click on the links below to read his story and follow the Facebook page that has been created to follow his recovery.“The snake kills by squeezing very slowly.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/dodys-ditching-diabetes,Dody's Ditching Diabetes!,"With Type 1 Diabetes, the body does not produce insulin.  Dody Thompson was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes over 15 years ago and doctors have classified her as a ""Brittle Diabetic"".  If that weren't enough, 8 years ago she was diagnosed with Gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is where the nerve endings go bad in the stomach and make it very hard to digest food.  Dody and her doctors have tried several different options and nothing seems to be working.  In fact, her diabetes has become life threatening and she has had many hypoglycemic episodes.  There are few things more scary than having low blood sugar, being able to hear people talking to you, but not being able to respond.  This is especially true when it's her teenage son, Cord, trying to help bring her back around.  So, several months ago, Dody started going through testing to be evaluated for a pancreas transplant and was placed on the transplant list almost 7 weeks ago. Last night, Dody received the call she has waited and prayed for; a donor pancreas was located! This morning, Jan 4, 2016, Dody was taken to surgery at 10:05am for her new pancreas!  We are setting up this gofundme account to help Dody with expenses of the many post op medications which are very expensive. The funds will also be helpful to Dody while she is off work recovering, which could be 10-12 weeks.

He has undergone a back fusion, but still lives with chronic pain. Over the holidays, Craig was outfitted with a temporary spinal chord stimulator that lasted five days. Those five days are the first in 15 years that he has been without constant pain. In order to have the procedure to insert a permanent spinal chord stimulator, the Walkers would need to come up with $8,800. Those of us who work with Craig everyday, and know how important he is to our school, would love to bless the Walkers and make this procedure possible for Craig. We are looking for others who will join us and help Craig live a pain free life for the first time 15 years. Craig, along with his wife Linda, is a teacher at Grace Classical, a small Christian school in Prosper, Texas. Craig has devoted his life to ministry and advancing the kingdom of God. Despite the pain he lives with every day, Craig walks around the school with a smile on his face looking for ways to serve. If Craig is not in the classroom teaching, you can often find him throughout the school replacing light bulbs when they go out, helping set up the sanctuary for Chapel, or fixing a broken leg on a desk in the Grammar school. Thank you for taking the time to read Craig's story.

I am the sweetest girl, I love everybody I meet! On Chirstmas day I gave my pawrents a huge scare when I got sick and passed out for a moment. It happened twice within a minute and they rush me to the ER vet.  Once there it took a little while to figure out what was exactly going on. I had to stay the night in the oxygen tank and they came to the conclusion I had two seperate issues going on. I had aspirated pnumonia and pulmonic stenosis.  I was refered to NC State cardiology.  Fast forward to yesterday (Jan 3), I was seen for another ekg and more test. The diagnosis is severe pulmonic stenosis  with possible coronary artery anomaly. They have recommended a balloon procedure to help the blood flow in my heart and reduce the work flow. They will not know until they do a CT scan if for sure if I have coronary artery anomaly but they suspect I do. If this is the case the risk of complications is slightly higher than without this. (approx. 5% vs 1-2%).  They have also started me on Atenolol to help reduce the pressure on my heart.My pawrents have decided to try the surgery to help give me the best quality of life for as long as I have. They love me so much and I will do anything they can to help me. The surgery is estimated to cost $3500-$4500. My pawrents have already spent $2300 from my ER visit and consulation on the cardiologist. We appreciate anything you can do, a donation, prayer, good vibes, whatever. We have made so many furiends through instagram and LOVE our wonderful community!! THANK YOU !!As of now surgery is scheduled for Jan. 18th. I will check in Jan 17th and if all goes well released on the 19th. If there are any questions you can contact mommy or if you prefer to donate directly I'm being seen at NC State cardiology. If you would like to follow me on instagram you can find me @bulldog_chloebelle",https://images.gofundme.com/8CBgdMNF3q2bmTzxNADnOOJtMbY=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17192424_1483553190.129.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Melissa Moser is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,400 raised of $4,500 goal"

As many of you have already heard, I have a last minute opportunity to join some amazing physicians and residents on a one week medical service trip to Honduras this February. I was first introduced to global outreach in college after spending a month volunteering at a Ukrainian orphanage (that's where the picture is from). It was a highly humbling yet rewarding experience to help run a summer camp with my American and Ukrainian teammates in order improve the education and morale of these children. This experience further enhanced my passion for global outreach and I knew it was not going to be my last service trip abroad. Thus I am very excited to have such an amazing opportunity to join this trip to Honduras. Participating with this team will not only fulfill my life long desire of helping to improve medical outcomes in underserved populations abroad, it will also give me the much needed patient experience for my physician assistant application I will be submitting this summer. The organization I will be going with, ENLACE Honduras Foundation, is completely funded by volunteers and regularly sends service teams to Honduras to provide quality medical care at their clinic site. I am certain this experience will be highly rewarding, educational and will assist me in my long term goal of becoming a culturally competent and sensitive medical provider here in the US! Please let me know if you are willing to help fund my service trip and know how much I greatly appreciate your support!Tamila GarbuzTrip dates: Feb 4 – Feb 12th, 2017Cost: $2000, including airfare, lodging, meals, and medical supplies for the clinicOrganization: ENLACE Honduras Foundation – Run by Indiana University School of Medicine physicians, Dr. Sevilla and Dr. Kelton",https://images.gofundme.com/lqZaBXuZa8sBVEUlMq1u6lvQVXE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17192516_1483553971.2021.jpg,[],0,"Created January 9, 2017",Tamila Garbuz is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$2,175 raised"

My husband loss his job 3 different times within one year and since then we have loss our apartment and both our cars got repo'd.We were sitting in our car one late night talking and praying about what our next move was going to be because we just got the notice earlier that day we had less than 2 weeks to move. We fell off to sleep in the car and at about 3am we were awaken by our car being jacked up by the repo guys. Saddened and stressed we handed over our keys and removed our belongings and we're thinking wow, what's next??!!So now we're out with no place to go. We had just enough to rent a car and we checked into nearby shelter.My children have also been effected by this circumstance. My oldest son ran away the day we checked into that shelter because he didn't like our living arrangements. While in the streets with friends he got caught in an unfortunate situation and some guy started shooting and my son's his friend got shot in the face and my son got away unharmed. He knew it was only God that protected him that night. We have to get our kids out of this situation. They are teenagers 13, 14, and 16 and it's hard for them to adapt to this and still stay focus and commited to their studies in school. They tell us they often wonder what will happen to their reputation if their friends found out about their situation. They don't like to hang out with friends for fear of them finding out. We are all staying in one room an although this situation has brought us close as a family; it still has its challenges even to the point of attacking our marriage and the responsibilities we have to one another.

I am taking six weeks out of my summer so travel to East Asia(May 14th-June 24th)! This trip is through an orginization called Cru, in which I am apart of at North Carolina State Univerity. I will be traveling with approximatly 10 other students, and three leaders. In East Aisia, I will be staying at an university, at which I will be spreading the word of God to students around the school through making friendships, helping people in need, and showing God's love to the students. Here is a bit of information about the trip directly from the CRU website:""East Asia is one of the fastest growing regions of the world no matter which socio-economic measure you use. The population is growing, industry is booming, economies are strengthening; all happening at the center of one of the oldest and longest standing civilizations in the history of the world. Traditional values and economic progress collide in the rapidly thickening city streets. College campuses add to that, with the education of every student in the world's widest known language, English, giving the national students a unique opportunity for even greater success and advancement in the global economy.And yet this culture is hurting from the inside out. There are fewer Christians per capital than in almost any other area of the world. As an American college student, you have a unique opportunity to engage the hearts of students who study on these college campuses. You will likely have people walk directly up to you and simply ask to be your friend. You couldn't ask for a better conversation starter!"" (Cru.org)I am very excited for this trip as I hope to continue my growth in Jesus, strengthen my communication skills and build new relationships.  As soon as I heard about this trip,  I knew it was something that I couldn't pass up-- it was the perfect fit!  It is a big step out of my comfort zone, which will hopfully help me pursue my life goals.  That being said, I ask for prayers and if it is on your heart to give a donation I would appreciate it beyond words.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/leaping-for-laiche,Leaping for Laiche,"In April of 2016, my family and I experienced a monumentous change in our lives. On April 28, my father, Cole Laiche, had his left leg amputated, but this has not been a definitive cure for any of the problems he is still currently battling. Since May 2013, my dad has had extensive problems with his knees and overall health. He has undergone 21 knee surgeries including his amputation, and 11 different cases of life-threatening infections including sepsis which threatened acute renal failure for several days until brought under control. He has come home with over 12 PICC lines (peripherally inserted central catheter) receiving antibiotics over intervals of 6 to 12 weeks with each PICC line. Prior to May 2013, my dad has had 13 knee surgeries and 1 infection for a current total of 34 surgeries. While many family members and doctors alike believed that amputation would bring relief to both my father and my family, this is not totally the case. My dad still has to have a minimum of one surgery to evaluate his current status of his remaining leg. Over the past several months, this leg has been infected twice, keeping my dad wheel-chair bound. His leg currently has a metal rod keeping it fused straight and he is on another PICC line to fight the infection from spreading and hoping to rid him of it completely. Now anyone can clearly see how extensive the physical damage of this illness has been, but many do not completely understand the emotional toll this takes on both the patient and the family. Since my dad has been unemployed for the last three and a half years, mounting medical bills have become an enormous stress on the family. The constant worry that he is unable to provide assistance to make ends meet causes an extra amount of emotional stress that hinders his focus and ability to heal. My dad is a very proud man and to not be a major contributor to the household causes tribulation. My step-mom has had to pick up much responsibility. She has become the sole provider of the household and has had to take off numerous days from work in order to be with him and care for him in his hospitializations and most sick states. She has depleted most of her paid time off of work as a school nurse and is doing her absolute best to provide for the family. Without the support we have gotten from our extended family it would have been impossible to make it this far without reaching out for help, however, it has gotten to the point where the worry and stress over finances is affecting his health. My father doesn't want to lose the little bit the family has and wants to be able to actually pay the bills. The bills are not the only expenses that are burdening him. He has obtained numerous expenses because of the amputation. Prostethics are very expensive. Making things handi-capped are very expensive. All things on top of medical bills and daily living bills that are necessary for his recovery have been very costly.  With everything he has been through, it is understandable that my dad would be stressed and worried, but he still makes a conscious effort to be positive and do everything in his power to make things easier on the family and for that, I look up to him. He is one of the strongest people I have ever met in my life.  I graciously reach out to any of you who are willing to help in any way large or small.  All donations will go towards paying medical bills and the expense of care for my father.  We thank you all for your help, but most important, we thank you for your thoughts and prayers.",https://images.gofundme.com/9SqQ4C52hMmSLxcoL0HRuw5wtX0=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17192710_1483569084.4234.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17192710_1483654711.139_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 5, 2017",Blaire Laiche is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Milette Laiche.,Other,"$10,980 raised of $100,000 goal"

I don't know where to start to tell our story but, I will start with who she is and go from there.  Julie is a stay at home mom. She has an adult daughter, a 15 year old daughter and is primary care giver to her 6 year old grand daughter. On Monday evening, she was getting up to go into another room and collapsed. She fell onto her stomach and Hannah was home. Hannah immediatley called 911. When the paramedics arrived, Julie was unresponsive and did not have a pulse. She was revived and taken to the emergency room in Austin and then transfered to Mayo Clinic in Rochester. She coded a few more times in the ambulance on the way to Rochester. She is currently in a coma after having a few heart attacks. She was deprived of oxygen long enough to substain substantial brain injury.  We don't know the full extent yet but we will within the next few hours.  She is currently on life support breathing by ventialtor.  We will be removing life support as her tests determined that she does not have function in the areas of her brain that she would need to survive.  Julie was a wonderful woman, she didn't have much but things aren't what she was made for. When my siblings and I were younger, she cared for us. She was OUR mom too. Julie used to run a day care and all of the kids from her daycare also can say the same. She was their mom too. If you look at her facebook page you will see several posts stating just that. Julie was a mom to anyone who walked in the door. She didn't care if you were 'one of us' or not, YOU were one of us.   This is completely unexpected and we as a family can not do this alone. My sister, Jami, will be taking care of our niece and her grand daughter. But she is a teacher and can not do this alone either. We are asking for help to cover unexpected funeral expenses and additional support to help my sister raise the two girls.",https://images.gofundme.com/jtFW-1xWm3V82kqnhoVeKSh9zVQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17193408_1483555847.3977.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Amanda Reed is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$1,650 raised of $25,000 goal"

It has been a lifelong ambition of his to visit Easter Island, and a few years ago he decided he wanted to spend his 50th birthday there. Unfortunately, on a limited public sector wage and with four (unfathomably) hungry mouths to feed at home, he has never managed to save enough to get there. That's where you wonderful people come in.I'm asking for anyone who is able to, to donate whatever they can spare (however small an amount) towards the costs of sending him to Easter Island in October this year. He needs flights, accomodation and food for a week-long trip, and I've worked out that would cost around £2000. So if you might have given Mark a present or spent money on a celebratory night out, perhaps you would consider donating the money instead. Mark has been a massive support to me over the past few difficult months, and I would love to be able to give him this trip myself but just can't do it alone. For those of you who know Mark well, you will also know that he has a fear of flying equivalent to B. A Baracus's. A trip like this would be a great way to overcome that fear. A bit like a rite of passage, but for middle-aged folks.Together we can send him on the trip of his lifetime and help him launch into a new decade with a feeling that he has achieved one of his biggest dreams. And in the knowledge that he is surrounded by incredible people who care about him enough to send him off across the world on his own in a very small plane. I would be eternally grateful for any help you can give. And I know Mark would be too. Of course, this is top secret, so please keep it quiet, and don't tell any kids who might tell mine.

The company we work for administers union health insurance plans, retirement, and other union benefit plans. We are the frontline staff who process incoming contributions, process claims, answer phones, and make sure pension checks go out on time. We are here fighting to keep fundamental union standards such as seniority rights (a process that is fair especially for things like layoffs!), a cap on medical premium cost share, and contributions to our 401k  to reestablish our retirement after we agreed to withdraw from our pension last year. We understand that concessions are sometimes necessary in bargaining, and we’ve made them in the past, but we believe it’s also important at times to stand up for what is right and fight for what’s fair. This is why we are out on strike, and we’re ready to stay strong, but we need support to help us cover expenses and support our families as our fight continues.

This means that she has a leaky heart valve which is severe enough to cause blood to leak into the upper chamber, which is damaging to the heart. After undergoing multiple tests, her medical team will perform surgery on Thursday, January 5 in order to repair or replace the valve. Doctors have stated that they will not know until they get inside whether a replacement or repair will be required, but we are hoping for a repair.Regardless of the outcome of repair or replacement, Lindsay will have at least 6 weeks of recovery, including some time in the ICU. Lindsay is self employed and the mother of a fantastic daughter, and could miss more work than just the 6 weeks expected for the recovery. Without Lindsay's income and the additional medical bills which are sure to arrive, there will be a lot of stress on all members of the family for the next few months. Compounding the stress, this is all happening along with scheduled corrective foot surgeries for Lindsay's daughter; one was in December 2016 and another expected in the upcoming spring or summer months.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/andraea-hillman-ms-hcst-treatment,Andraea Hillman MS HSCT Treatment,"In April 2007 I was diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a progressive disease where your own body attacks your central nervous system causing scarring (lesions) to form which interrupt signals sent from the brain to the rest of the body. There is currently no cure for MS. I have always been someone on the move and now have 2 daughters to love and care for, except that MS is slowly halting things that make that possible. When diagnosed at 25 years old, I had numbness throughout the entire left side of my body. With time feeling in my body resumed but about 5 years ago my MS symptoms began to reappear, new and old. It has made it so running and jogging are no longer possible and walking is not without difficulty, having to think about every step I take. I have numbness and unbearable spasms in both legs and feet. I have a huge lack of focus and concentration and memory loss is very big. It's as if most of my childhood and teenage years are nonexistent in my brain.  Hot weather aka heat sensitivity makes every symptom so much worse including fatigue. There are more symptoms that have come about but not being able to keep up with my girls and enjoy life to the fullest with them has really hit me the hardest, along with knowing that my symptoms will only get worse with time. The doctors at northwestern were surprised given so many lesions on my spine that I'm not furthur along.This unpredictability of what lies ahead for me makes life very hard. I learned about Hemotopioetic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) through emails I receive from the National MS Society. Hearing of its possibilities has finally given me hope. HSCT will for sure stop the progression of MS and I'll no longer need the endless injections and medications. Also as a bonus it has been shown to reverse some current symptoms and helped some regain neurologic functions previously lost. This treatment reboots the faulty immune system using chemotherapy and then rebuilds it using the patients own stem cells. The idea is for your immune system to learn all over again which things to attack like viruses and bacteria and which to leave alone, like Myelin (the protective covering around your nerves).  It is performed in 16 hospitals around the world for MS and I have been accepted for treatment  in Chicago with Dr. Burt  at Northwestern Memorial Hospital! I'm nervous and excited all the same for the possibilities to come of this treatment! I am asking for support to overcome this disease and financial help to aide with medical, travel and hotel expenses being I will have to spend over a month in Chicago. The time is broken tho having to go back and forth traveling 3 separate times, staying half of the time in the hospital and the other half in a hotel. This life changing  treatment costs $125,000 as a deposit only. More medical costs will occur I'm sure during treatment. I've been denied 3 times by independence blue cross and now have to pay out of pocket. Hopefully i will still be able to start treatment early May as that was my plan. Your support will help put my mind as well as my husbands at ease, while he takes great care of our beautiful  children while mommys away getting better. Thank you all for your love and support and for your donations.

The feeling of love is so profound, it's incredible and surprising.” ― Nia VardalosFor as long as i can remember, I've always felt like i would be a mother. I didn't know the circumstances, I just knew. I met my husband when I was 14 and although the love is endless children just hadn't happened for us as quickly as we could have hoped. After i retired from the Navy we figured the process would go more smoothly but once again, we were waiting. Suddenly,  just over a year ago God blessed us with the greatest gift of all, a sweet little girl. The unexpected part was she wasn't growing in my belly! Isabellas mother was going through a rough time and we offered to care for Isabella until she got back on her feet. A chance to love a little girl, you didnt have to ask us twice! (:  Well, weeks turned into months and before we knew it we were wrapped around her little finger and couldnt imagine a day without this sweet little girl. By the grace of God her mother asked if we would like to adopt her and my heart completely melted. Our answer was YES! it had been what we wanted all along and our family was complete with her in our lives. Unfortunately, adoptions aren't cost efficient and after a year of love we are ready to give this little girl the world without looking back for a second! In our hearts it doesnt matter how God gave us a child it just matters that she is here and she is ours. She amazes me everyday with just how smart and loving she is. My heart still flutters every time she calls me mommy and grabs my neck for a hug and i cant help but feel just how lucky we truly are. I want Isabella to always feel that love as she grows older, i want her to know that DNA doesnt matter and she is ours. So here we are, in the middle of the legal process of adoption weighing our options. I'm not asking for a miracle, but whatever is offered will help give our little girl two parents that love her very deeply and a new last name :) any proceeds raised will be spent on legal fees and costs that it takes to complete this process and give this sweet baby a forever home. If for some reason there is money we dont need to spend we have discussed ( and agreed on) donating any possible leftover money to an agency/family that is also dealing with the wonders of adoption :) Thank you for reading this and i hope you can find it in your heart to help us give Isabella her Happily Ever After!

My father started not feeling well the last week in October 2016.  He thought he strained a hernia he had for years but it was just not getting better.  I decided that I needed to take him to the hospital to find out what was going on as it usually settles down in about a week.  The Dr decided to do a CT scan and unfortunately, we found out it was not the hernia that he had aggravated.  They found a large tumor in his bowel and lesions on his liver.  A few days later, we found ourselves at some emergency appointments and a few days after that my father had to have emergency surgery.They refused to remove the tumor and we refused a biopsy and their recommendation for their medical treatment options.I truly know the heart felt pain that many of you have gone through with the medical system and trying to fight for your health. In just a few short days, all you hope and believe can be challenged and you can be questioning all the natural health choices you have made.

On top of all that, as if that wasn't enough, the cancer has spread to his lymph glands. We are now back to the chemo treatments. Meanwhile he has been unable to work and applied for disability, and was approved, but lo and behold, how our wondeful government works, the payments don't start for 6 months. I am not sure why they have a waiting period. I am not sure if they think he will magically get better, but, here lies the problem. We are getting further behind on our bills. Flat truth, we can't make it, the bills keep coming. If we do manage to hold out until April when disability starts, we will be so far behind on them I am afraid we will never catch up. We are not looking to raise money for trips, cars or a big party, just to help us make it. We ask for any help you can give.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/teachingresidencyTanzania,My teaching residency in  Africa,"Hello!I am creating this campaign to help fund an extraordinary opportunity for myself as an artist and as a single mother of two amazing girls Kodie age 17 and Zana age 8. I have been awarded this very special artists residency for 10  weeks in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania to work and teach amongst other contemporary artists in this very special place in Africa. They have also invited me to bring along my daughters, which is so fantastic for all three of us to do this as a family. I have never been able to do a residency before because most of them do not allow artists to bring along family members, so this is quite extraordinary. The timing also could not be better as this is the last summer we have together before my oldest goes of to University in the fall. The funding that I am asking for will go towards the travel expenses , art and teaching workshop materials, art transportation and living costs during our stay. We have housing and a studio for me to work in, but htis residency is completely self-funded otherwise. I am hoping to get the funds completely sourced by April 1st at the latest to organize all of the necessary details to make the trip as smoothe as possible.It is so difficult to be a working female artist and make a living, let alone raise a family completely on my own.I decided a long time ago to take on a life of exploration for myself and when I had my girls that did not change. They actually inspired me to explore even more and show them how to be adventurous and un-afraid of some risk. We have had a bit of a nomadic lifestyle, which is hard, but contributes a lot to my work and their education. I am always considering the different methods and processes for creating work in a variety of environments. I am inspired by the challenges in creating new and diverse architecture in my work and feel there is a lot to gain in observing and participating in different cultures and the individual approaches to it. I would love to go to Nefasi Contemporary art space in Tanzania to participate in this artist residency to discover and appreciate fellow artistic development and practice, as well as contribute my own approach and understanding. I strive to constantly challenge my inspiration and energy to create my work. I need to participate in new artistic speech and aesthetics, different from what I am used to in my own surroundings, to explore and absorb new colours, forms and materials and to re-discover the artistic process and theoretical tools through a different culture. I am very inspired by the patterns/forms and connections of shapes within many examples of textile and painting traditions within different parts of Africa, but I am also curious to learn from the modern and contemporary artists working today.I would be so thankful for your support to be able to take this opportunity of growth and development in my career as a painter and as a mother, for my girls, to show them how there is so much to be learned from the world around us and to not be afraid to go for what you want in life! Thank you from the bottom of my heartHeatherNafasi Art Space heather chontos studio",https://images.gofundme.com/srhgj6tBA2UyicubI7fmsEo28Tk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194226_1483557685.8012.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194226_1483561737.0791_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194226_1483561798.856_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194226_1483561855.5646_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194226_1483561920.1169_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194226_1483562884.2386_funddescription.png']",5,"Created January 4, 2017",Heather Chontos is organizing this fundraiser.,"Creative Arts, Music & Film","$4,325 raised of $10,000 goal"

Those of us who knew her can only describe her as one of the most giving and loving people you would ever meet. While she suffered from MS, she never used that as a reason to stop blessing others.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-big-e-fund,The Big E  Fund,"Dear Friends of Eric, On December 12th Eric was checked into the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Jupiter Medical Center for some symptoms of heart failure.  His room mate happens to be an ER PA and she was with him that evening and recognized his symptoms and immediately brought him into the ER.  Eric was diagnosed with 95% and 75% arterial blockage to his heart.  She most likely saved his life at that moment in time.  He was treated and 3 stents  were put in to clear his arteries.   In addition to the heart issues, he was also diagnosed with severe gallbladder failure.   They were unable to operate and take it out due to his heart condition and in combination  with the new stents plus the blood thinners, they decided to hold off for 4-6 weeks to allow him to recover.   On New Years eve his gallbladder become very inflamed and possibly infected which sent him back into the ER for an emergency gallbladder surgery.  He is now recovering from that procedure.Flashback to 2016 and it was quite an amazing year for Eric.  In pursuit of his professional golf career, he qualified for and competed in the 2016 US Senior Open Championship and won the Connecticut Senior Open in dramatic style winning by a stroke.  Feeling that his game was peaking, he entered the PGA Champions Tour Qualifying School in November and finished 14th out of a field of  some of the best golfers in the world. This provides him his conditional status as a PGA Champions Tour member for the 2017 season.   Feeling pumped and ready to roll, Eric has been in Florida getting ready for the start of the 2017 PGA Champions Tour Season.  All of you know his life long persuit to play golf on the worlds best Tour!  Unfortunately this crises  happened while he was making those other plans.  This past month has dealt Eric some serious setbacks with his health and now a major setback to his financial circumstances.   Eric will have a fairly long road to recovery, rehabilitation and physical conditioning to get back on his feet and tournament ready.  Eric works as a caddie at the exclusive Dye Preserve Golf Club in Jupiter Fl and Burning Tree CC in Washington DC  as means to support himself when he's not playing golf professionally.  Unfortunately that won't be an option for the next several months and possibly beyond due to the surgeries.The Big E Friends Network  is reaching out to the wonderfully supportive community  of friends, colleagues and business associates to help get Eric back on his feet, get healthy and return to playing golf on the PGA Champions Tour.   Eric has been very humbled by having to reach out this way but he needs some financial support to  help him through this time.  That's the bottom line.  If he could do this himself, he would as most of you know.  Eric is extremely grateful for all the friends, friends of friends and even strangers that have all reached out to show their love and support during this difficult time.  He feels that he has been given a second chance at life of which he is very fortunate for this  incredible gift.  This is one mulligan he is happy to take!   Once he is healed and back on his feet, he is determined to get back out and go low on his back nine of life.Lets help Eric get back on his feet and take care of some of his financial burden as a result of this recent event.Sincerely, The Big E Friends Network",https://images.gofundme.com/UF-DPlSUfrlhfYI3khHsDEvniA4=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194350_1483657900.0732.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194350_1483658152.8188_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 4, 2017",Eric Egloff is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$52,751 raised of $35,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/abigailkimler,"Send Abigail to Heartbridge, YWAM","Hello Friends and Family,I'm so excited to share that I've been accepted to Heartbridge Performing Arts Center Youth with A Mission, in Kona, Hawaii. I have been praying and seeking God on how He wants me to use the gift of dance that He gave me and He lead me to this Christian Arts School.Heartbridge Performing Arts DTS Video  Heartbridge YWAM Kona is a Discipleship Training School (DTS) for those who feel God is drawing them to grow deeper spiritually and use their passion for performing to glorify Him. It is a program in which the teaching and application are designed to bring each person closer to God. As my relationship with God is building I will be encouraged to use the gifting’s He gave me to bring others from all over the nations to Him. Each person’s talents, skills and experiences are dedicated to His glory.   I started taking ballet at 5 years old from a Christian ballet school, Adonai Ballet Academy. I fell in love with dance from the very first class. Over the years I used dance as a way to escape from the stress of life and any problems I was having. I used dance to show emotions that were hard to communicate through words and as a way to push myself to become the best I could be.  One year my twin Joanna and I joined a local trainee dance company that had community outreach. We danced in schools and multiple nursing homes but nothing impacted me more than when we visited a local children’s shelter. This shelter fed, taught, loved, and cared for the abused and troubled children of the community. I will never forget watching the sadness in those kids eyes turn to joy for the short time they watched our group perform. Not only did we get to dance for them, but we also got to dance with them together as a group and then help them make crafts about the dancing. I felt then, and still feel so blessed to have had that time to spread the joy of dancing with those kids. I really saw how dance has a way of speaking straight to the emotions, no matter what age people are. I got to be the one to bring a little light into these children’s eyes, even if it was just for a moment. I learned how it impacts the audience as well as the dancer, because a message can be communicated to any age audience through the beauty of movement.    During my senior year of high school, I put dance onto the back burner to focus on school and getting a degree, but I felt like a part of me was missing. Through the years I've used dance as a way to communicate emotions and stories in a message without words that points an audience to Jesus while still having an impact on them from the feelings experienced while watching. Towards the end of my freshman year of college my ballet teacher, Rachel made me realize the calling God had put in my heart to pursue dance. She challenged me to follow my passion for dance and find what God had planned for me through going fully towards dance, so I took a gap year off college and decided to try and join a Dance Company. It’s amazing how through a series of events God pointed me towards Heartbridge Performing Arts Center. I not only will get to deepen my relationship with my Heavenly Father at this Discipleship Training Program, but I will get to do what I love the most and use it for Gods kingdom. This Program is something I dreamed about before I knew there was a possibility that can be made into reality. The program is six months long starting in April 2017 until September 2017. The first three months are dedicated to training, discipleship, and working on a production called; “Coming Home.” (A modern version of The Prodigal Son).I will be studying and training in Kona Hawaii at the YWAM University of the NationsHeartbridge Performing Arts Center's base. This means I will be living on campus in their facilities.  For those first three months the total cost is around $5,000, which includes housing, food, training, and travel expenses.The last half of the program is a mission trip where the team will be performing “Coming Home” and doing outreach in each town we visit. Through dance, acting, song, prayer, and the Arts we will be spreading Gods love throughout Germany, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Norway and many other places in Europe.   The total cost for the last three months and this mission trip is around $7,000, which includes all air fare, food, lodging, and other travel expenses. The only way for me to make this dream a reality is through your prayer and support and I know that with God all things are possible! YWAM’s goal perfectly explains the whole goal for this DTS program:Know God and Make Him Known.    Please Join me in this journey in spreading Gods love and the gospel to the Nations through the Performing Arts!If you feel led to give, please make checks out to Global Worship and put my name in the memo or you can donate online by clicking the link at the bottom of the page.Thank you so much for helping me to grow in my walk with Jesus and to use dance to share Christ to the nations. I see dance as my ministry, my way to show others the wonders of my great God. Dancing is my way of expression and to be able to use the gift of dance to bring others into Christ’s kingdom is the greatest honor.With love,Abigail Kimler2016 Campus Tour - YWAM Kona",https://images.gofundme.com/lToFkABXH58YRPcCtiviDTwICJA=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194372_1483564860.3758.png,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Robin Thompson Kimler is organizing this fundraiser.,"Missions, Faith & Church","$1,864 raised of $12,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36vsaz4,Please Help Save Our Home,"My friends have urged me to swallow my pride, push through my stubbornness and ask for help. I've started this campaign so I can at the least know I tried everything. I'm 34, I have a 6 year old son and I have multiple sclerosis. I've never been a ""victim"" and fortunately was raised by parents, who taught me the value of hard work, the importance of accountibility and to never give up. I'm trying to save my home and stay off the system. I have fought hard for the life I have. Ive never allowed having MS to slow me down. I want to instill the same values into my son, as my parents did me. I've had a very hard year, due to actions of others, which is the only reason I'm reaching out. I invested all my savings into purchasing a home to invest in mine and my child's future. A string of unfortunate unforseen circumstances has put me here, needing help. My mistake was trusting and believing in people, who claimed to have my best interest at heart. Anyone who knows me knows I won't ask for help until I have no other choice. I'm now at that point. This is hard for me to do and embarrassing. But when I became a mother I vowed to do whatever I had to do to give my son the best life I was capable of giving and I'm swallowing my pride to honor that promise. I won't be homeless, even if I can't save our home, It's hard to even ask for help, knowing so many others are in a far worse place. I received a demand letter from my mortgage company giving me until the end of thr month to bring the account current.  I'm not giving up or expecting to be saved with donations. I'm still working as much as possible, selling whatever I can, I'm only asking for help, because I have tried everything else.  It's not as easy for me as others, unfortunately  having a neurological condition makes everyday life 10x harder. I don't want pity, as I'm grateful to be as healthy as I am. I just need help to save what I've worked for despite the roadblocks life has thrown at me.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/bush-family-expenses,Bush Family Expenses,"On Tuesday afternoon, Josh and Stacey Bush received the kind of news that is every parent's worst nightmare. Their 17-year-old son, Gavin, who had been missing for four days had been found, but he wouldn't be coming home ever again. Josh and Stacey have been married for over twenty years and have created a wonderful family together. They brought six bright and beautiful children into the world, filling their home with love, laughter, and joyful chaos as they guided and nurtured their precious gifts from God - always making their children's happiness and well-being a top priority. Last Friday, their son Gavin inexplicably walked away from the Bush's home and cut off all contact with his family and friends. More than four days later, after an exhaustive search involving law enforcement, desperate pleas on social media, and independent searches, Gavin's body was discovered in a wooded area not far from his home, confirming his parent's worst fears - their son isn't coming home to them. There are no words that can convey the depth of the agony that Gavin's family is now suffering as they face their future without him. Please take a moment to pray for the entire Bush family, that God will take them in his arms and provide them with strength, comfort, and eventual peace. While condolences and prayers are valuable beyond measure, if you are able to, I humbly ask that you also contribute to this fund to help Josh and Stacey as they are forced to deal with the enormous expenses related to the loss of their child. Not only will the memorial and funeral costs be staggering, they will both also need to take significant time off from their jobs and will face a myriad of other unforseen expenses. Your heart-felt donation will help them to have peace of mind in knowing they will be better able to cover these costs without facing the added burden of worrying about how they will also cover their family's usual financial obligations.I know some of you who are reading this won't have had the pleasure of meeting them, but Josh and Stacey Bush are incredible, kind, and hardworking people and my life has been enriched by knowing them and calling them friends. The Bush family has been an extended part of my own family back in Iowa for almost a decade and though I'm only lucky enough to personally see and spend time with them once a year on trips home, those visits are always full of fun and laughter as unforgettable memories are made.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/jerrys-als-fund,Jerry's ALS fund,"Jerry's children ( Hannah, Jesse, and Jenn) are writing this on behalf of Jerry Kyhill.If you do not know Jerry , we will give you a brief summary of who he is.  Jerry Kyhill is one of the most genuine, caring, lovable, and warm people you will ever meet.  He is a beautiful person with a kind soul; who is always looking at the brighter side of life.  He has been the proud owner and chef of Sal's Italian Restaurant for over 30+ years; he makes the best food and he has spoiled his family and friends with his cooking his whole life.  As you can see from some of these photos, Jerry was an extremely active man.  He absolutely LOVED biking, fishing, swimming, golfing, basketball, raquetball, baseball, and spending time with his grandchildren.  His favorite travel spot would be any beach, however his number one spot is Wells, Maine or Long Boat Key, FL.  He is the kind of person who would say "" Don't worry, be happy mon"" .  He has always been a fun loving, active, and positive person,  As some of you may know, recently on his 69th birthday, Jerry was emergently hospitalized at the UVM medical center in Burlington, VT.  He was intubated in the ICU for several days , as we found out he was diagnosed with a horrible, terminal illness called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS) AKA Lou Gerhig's disease.  ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, there is no cure.  Jerry has respiratory failure secondary to ALS, which means he cannot breath on his own and he is ventilator dependent.  After a few family meetings and decisions, Jerry decided to get a tracheostomy tube ( which is a tube in his trachea) that is hooked to a ventilator machine to help him breath.  He also has a feeding tube in his stomach ( to give him important nutrients at this time).  Currently, Jerry is still in the hospital, he has various therapy teams working with him to evaluate his swallowing, physical stamina, and much more.  Although Jerry cannot breath on his own he is still able to write, use his ipad/iphone, watch sports, listen to his favorite music, and visit with friends and family.  He cannot talk, however we are able to read his lips.  Currently, he is able to get up with a walker and walk with assist.  His leg and arm strength is adequate at this time.  ALS is variable in regards to symptoms and progression; therefore the doctor's do not know the timeline of decline for Jerry, but at this time he is able to enjoy a few things he loves.  He wrote to us that his quality of life now is: his family, friends, sports, reading, music and writing.  He did ask the doctor what his outlook on biking and fishing were with a tracheostomy and PEG tube....he has always been an optimist!In the next few weeks , there will be some diffcult descisions made in regards to where Jerry goes after hospital discharge.  Jerry and his family would love for him to be able to go home and enjoy whatever time he has left in the comfort of his own home.  Jerry will need 24/7 homecare because he has a tracheostomy and ventilator.  We are asking for any type of donation to Jerry to help him and his wife Marj at this time with this financial burden.  All of the donations will go towards Jerry's homecare which include, equipment, 24/7 care from an aide or licensed caregiver, and much more.  Marj, his wife of 38 years has been suffereing with him throughout this awful disease as well; she will be his main caretaker at home.We would appreciate any type of donation to help Jerry and Marj through this dreadful situation.  We know how much Jerry would want to be home throughout the final days of his life and any support from you would warm our hearts. A long shot, but maybe we could raise enough money for Jerry to go to the beach one last time...not sure how possible it is but we will try if that is his wish. Thank you so much for reading our story and we appreciate your help more than you know. We also want to thank our friends and family who have reached out to provide meals, transportation, and support to Marj the past few weeks.  We feel the love!",https://images.gofundme.com/LkMsln70tEzFSKfdpu47IcHfKx8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559175.8228.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559406.4483_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559436.321_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559452.1019_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559916.0859_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559923.8553_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483559973.7853_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194546_1483623624.7383_funddescription.jpg']",7,"Created January 4, 2017",Hannah Mulligan is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jesse Kyhill.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$30,855 raised of $30,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-mommas-fight-with-rare-cancer,Traci's Fight With Rare Cancer,"In August of 2016, my mom went to the hospital with a very large ulcerating tumor on her breast.  At that time, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer as it had metasticized to her right lung and some of her lymph nodes .  She immediately began an incredibly potent form of chemo which reeked havoc on her body.  Unfortunately, the chemo was not as successful as the doctors had hoped so she went in for a masectomy/lympectomy and then continued with a second round of a different type of chemo. Only six weeks after her surgery, 5 new tumors appeared on her breast and the tumor on her lung was the size of a tennis ball. Around this same time, we were told by her oncologist that after testing the cancer cells they removed from her breast, they learned that my mom has metaplastic breast cancer.  Metaplastic cancer is an extremely rare and extremely aggressive form of cancer affecting only <1% of breast cancer patients.  Because of its rarity treatment is experimental and has proven to be unsuccessful this time.  In December, she was again admitted to the hospital for difficulty breathing and was consequently put on a breathing machine. Remaining optimistic, my mom began a third type of chemo with plans to begin radiation shortly thereafter.  Despite three doses of the new chemo, her tumors continued to grow rapidly and her ability to move around was almost non-existant. Within the last couple of weeks, her decline has been devasting and her cancer was deemed terminal.  We were advised by her oncologist to discontinue treatment. With the help of hospice, she is set up in her own home and our goal is to make mom as comfortable as possible throughout the rest of her time here with us. As many of you know, our dad is self-employed and mom has been unable to work since earlier this year.  Our parents have been raising 2 of their grandchildren for the last ten years and moving forward, dad will be raising them on his own.  Dad has been mom's primary care taker since this began as all of the treatments, surgery, and aggressive cancer really made it difficult for my mom to care for herself.  That being said, he hasn't had much time to dedicate to his business in the last five months.  Between the lack of work and the countless medical expenses, finances are a bit stressed.  Throughout her fight with this cancer, my mom has been so worried about my dad (they've been married for 31 years) and so worried about who would take care of her grandkids. Your donations would help my father catch up financially and allow him to continue providing for their grandchildren until he can get his business back up and running.  You would also be helping us provide my mom with the best treatment and comforts available to us.Thank you so much for reading my mom's story and thank you for considering her and our family.  It has been a painful and heartbreaking road for us and we are eternally grateful for all of the love we have received thus far.  Please feel free to share our story with your friends and family as well.  Here are some pictures of Momma and our family.",https://images.gofundme.com/S1ql3Pz3CE7Rco1WLJK1e_Ojljo=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194646_1483559439.9308.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194646_1483774925.004_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194646_1483775199.6881_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194646_1483775568.8444_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194646_1483776538.6152_funddescription.jpg']",4,"Created January 7, 2017",Tara Black is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Tara McCue.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$9,340 raised of $20,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/zadi-michel,My Tuition Fee for SMU,"The Beginning:(This is me with my Uncle, Grandmother, and sister)In 1990, when I was only six-years-old, the first open presidential election was held in my country. I decided on my own to walk more than 3 miles by myself to hear one of the presidential candidates speak in a neighboring village. My parents had no idea where I had gone! When I arrived, I was heartbroken to learn that I had missed the speech entirely. Tired and exhausted from the trek, I suddenly realized that I still had a chance to see the candidate. Though I only got a glimpse of him from a distance, that day was when I saw and believed that change was possible. Somewhere deep down inside of me I felt that I too could be an agent for change in my country, and my love of politics was sealed.Who Am I Now?My name is Zadi Zouzougbo and I come from the Ivory Coast, West Africa.  After earning my Masters Degree in Economics from the University de l’Atlantic, I left my country to move to the U.S in 2012 to study Human Rights.  From 2002-2011, I witnessed violations of human rights first hand when my country was in civil war.  I made the choice to come to the U. S. to study how to  prevent the type of atrocities my country was experiencing. I was here for the 2012 election and was working at Richland College as it was one of the voting places for that precinct.  I couldn't believe how quiet and respectful everyone was towards each other - no protesting, no one's life being threatened because they were casting their vote, and no violence.  It was another ""ah-ha"" moment for me.  If this can be done here, it can be done in my country.  I know that to make these changes will require educated people that have the vision, passion, and drive to make these changes happen.  I am one of those people.What I've Been Doing Since I've Been In The US:After graduating from Richland College in Dallas, Texas, I sought admittance to Southern Methodist University.  While at Richland, I was a member of the Richland College Honors Academy, The Richland Honors Club and Phi Theta Kappa.  I was one of four students to receive a Richland College Faculty Scholarship. In December of 2016, I became one step closer to my dream after being admitted to the SMU Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences.  Southern Methodist University is one the few schools nationwide that offers a program in Human Rights.  ""Michel was a member of the Richland College Honors Academy and Phi Theta Kappa honor society (the 2-year college equivalent to Phi Beta Kappa at 4 -year institutions). As my student in Honors-level Public Speaking, I saw that Michel was an excellent student, always eager to learn. He was a strong leader in our class and always took the toughest assignments in order to challenge himself. He was also held in high esteem by his classmates and was the type of student who was willing to assist others in group and team projects. ln short, he was the type of student who makes every class a pleasure to teach!""Carol H. KentRichland CollegeSpeech Faculty/ Faculty QEP Director""Zadi is a student and professional mentee, who in the last two years I have had the privilege to watch become an exceptional scholar.  Zadi is a quiet, compassionate, and relaible leader, who I am certain will one day make a difference in the lives of the 20+ million citizens of the Ivory Coast.  His life-long dream is to better himself so that, he can become an effective and efficient human rights leader, who is dedicated to building stronger communities and creating opportunities at the local and national levels.""""It is very difficult for international students to find and secure part-time employment on campus and to excell academically.  When he found campus employment, he was able to maintain an exceptional work ethic, grade point average and commitment to his leadership development.""""I am confident that Zadi has the maturity as well as the intellectual and professional capacity to excel at SMU.  I sincerely hope that he will be given the opportunity to pursue his educational goals at SMU, and to one day become a world changer in the Ivory Coast and in our world.""LaQueta L Wright, Ph.D.Dean of Social Sciences2006 Fulbright-Hays FellowRichland CollegeHere I am (that's me 4th from the right standing) doing community service work with my classmates.Why I Need Your Help:Now I need your help to continue my dream so that I can return home and put my education to good use.  What makes my case difficult is that I am on an F-1 visa status meaning I am limited to working 20 hours per week at an on-campus job, so I have no possibility to earn enough to pay for my tuition. The money raised here will be used not only to pay my first semester of tuition but will also go towards the cost of my books, school health insurance, as well as room & board. Classes begin on January 23rd, so I am hoping that you all will help me raise enough funds before then in order to register for my first semester of classes.What I want to do with my diploma:Since I was a boy, I have dreamed of learning about Human Rights for such a long time! When I finish my SMU degree I will go back to my country to be an agent of change. This money will surely allow me to complete my Master's degree in Human Rights, and it will indirectly also and surely impact the life of millions of my people in the Ivory Coast. I will be so grateful and honored to receive a donation from you because after witnessing war in my country, I want to use all the skills and knowledge that I will learn at SMU to impact in terms of social justice and reconciliation in my country through universal, public education for all children just as Nelson Mandela said, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"" to prevent these horrors from ever happening again.These children and I will be so grateful to you if you are able to make a donation towards my education.   Also, at the end the semester I will give an update to everyone regarding my performance and everything concerning your donation.Thank you so very much!!!Zadi Michel Zouzougbo",https://images.gofundme.com/1BLfds_Yb3U9cwWnK4D6ba8jafc=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1483558853.2201.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484238266.5714_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484233710.2351_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484238624.7882_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484340247.7569_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484349642.1402_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484238889.2101_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194726_1484237949.038_funddescription.jpg']",7,"Created January 4, 2017",Michel Kader Zadi is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$2,230 raised of $22,000 goal"

On December 3rd, 2016 they noticed some unsual behaviour with Aysen. A usual active toddler was losing his balance, couldn't crawl, and would shake as if he was having a seizure. By the end of the day on December 4th, Aysen had lost all capability of sitting, crawling, and standing. He was admitted to the Brandon Hospital by his pedatrician. While there, Aysen received some testing such as a Lumbar Puncture, EEG, and a CT scan of his brain. When they received the results back tumours, leukemia, and meningitis were all ruled out. There were some extra cells found in his Lumbar Puncture, which indicated some sort of virus, but they were unsure as to what kind it was. Atlee and Candace were told it was encephalitis (inflammation of the brain - viruses are a common cause of this), and his symptoms would get better, and Aysen was sent home December 8th. By the morning of December 9th, Aysen went back to the pediatrician as the shaking was contiuning and getting worse. Once again, they were told that the symptoms would get better and to bring Aysen back to the pediatrican the following Monday. Later that day, Aysen was taken to the Children's Hospital in Winnipeg and admitted immediately. After meeting with multiple specialists and having an MRI, they were devastated to find out that Aysen had a tumour in his abdomen and was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma. Aysen's symptoms are so rare (shaking, loss of motor capability), he's the 3rd case that the hospital has ever seen. The syndrome he was diagnosed with is called Opsoclonus Myoclonus Ataxia (an inflammatory neurological disorder - caused by a tumor).On December 16th, 2016, Aysen had surgery to remove the tumour and they were able to go home December 23rd, 2016. Aysen has since started treatment, steroids at home as well as two different types of treatment at the Children's Hospital until they are able to stabalize the tumour to be able to determine more information and details on Aysen's condition. Because Aysen now has a comprimised immune system, it is too dangerous for him to attend daycare resulting in Candace having to quit her job which she was supposed to return to after maternity leave on January 3rd, 2017.

Check out the writeups I have had in the local Portland Press Herald and nationally, on Reverb.comhttp://www.pressherald.com/2016/12/25/a-portland-engineer-is-building-his-dream-recording-studio-using-only-analog-technology-reels-of-tape-and-vintage-equipment/https://reverb.com/news/non-profit-non-digital-prism-analog-studio-in-maineMy mission is to provide affordable tape-based production services to local and regional independent artists while giving back to the community by offering mentorships, internships, and, by underwriting local music-related non-profits.I'm Nick, the Prism Analog founder/engineer. I have been in bands and performed engineering services in the digital and analog domains (for myself and others) dating back to my childhood. My dream has long been to create a space where artists can focus on their creative performance in a way that gives something to the community.I am OVER HALFWAY to realizing this dream! I have sourced and procured some incredible gear and have begun setting up in a terrific space in Portland's hip and craft-friendly East Bayside neighborhood.I have a beautiful 24-track 2"" tape machine, a Studer A800 MKIII which has been thoroughly restored. This is the Rolls Royce of tape machines and dominated the high end studios of the 80's and 90's. In fact this very machine recorded ""Siamese Dream"" by Smashing Pumpkins when it lived at Triclops Studios in Marietta, GA.In addition to the Studer, I have an Otari MTR-12 mixdown tape machine, a SoundWorkshop 34C mixing desk, and a nice variety of high quality microphones.I have also, with the help of nearly a dozen local musicians, nearly completed construction of the studio control room!But I'm out of money and need $10,000 to finish!Remaining to do are: sonic abatement and reflection treatments, a few spools of cabling and connectors, mic stands, procuring some remaining outboard gear, and setting up a maintenance and repair fund and a few months' rent.Prism Analog will produce music entirely in the ""Analog Domain”— recording and mixing down to tape. This process dominated music production from the late 1950s through the 1990s.It encourages a more “live” approach to studio work, favoring the well-rehearsed artist. Decisions need to be made in the moment that might otherwise be agonized over in post production.Tape is expensive, whereas tracks and hard drive space are virtually an unlimited and free commodity in digital production. Limited tracks and tape encourages fewer ""takes"" and fewer overdubs. This encourages more planning ahead on the part of the engineer and the artist.Track numbers are low, ranging from 2-24 tracks, and a curated stack of spatial, dynamic, and time-based analog effects are on hand to support our artists but not to overwhelm or confuse them.Not least, tracking to tape is arguably the only way to guarantee a future-proof master recording, and the only way to preserve 100% of your sound.",https://images.gofundme.com/YJsK84vIGy5MRr1TVwvwtXDs4iE=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194840_1483559069.893.png,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194840_1483559420.9259_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17194840_1483559507.2785_funddescription.jpg']",2,"Created January 4, 2017",Nick Johnson is organizing this fundraiser.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$2,242 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/izzyslemonaid,Help 8 y/o Izzy Help WWII Vets!,"In 2016, Isabella ""Izzy"" Grimes, 8 year old girl and founder of Izzy's Lemon Aid, was able to raise over $1300 to help send 3 World War II Veterans to Washington DC through Talons Out Honor Flight at no cost to them so they could see the WWII Memorial that was finally built in their honor, 59 years after the war ended.  According to statistics released by the Veteran's Administration, our World War II vets are dying at a rate of approximately 492 a day. This means there are approximately only 855,070 veterans remaining of the 16 million who served our nation in World War II.  In another 3-5 years, there will be no more WWII Veterans to send.Because of her hard work and dedication to our Nation's Vets, many festivals and events have contacted Izzy to be at their shows in 2017 so she can raise more money and send even more veterans on an Honor Flight. WE NEED YOUR HELP!2016 was a major success for us due to the AMAZING folks at Talons Out Honor Flight, our local media outlets and all of the selfless individuals who traveled near and far to buy our lemonade to support our Nation's Veterans! As a result, the people of Michigan heard about who we are and what we do. They now know that we only do this to help others. Once our costs are covered our profits are always donated to those who need it.Izzy has set a goal of $5000 for 2017 so she can send 10 more Veterans to Washington, D.C.As some of you already know, the way we brought Izzy's Lemon Aid to you in the past, was with an old, but reliable, landscaping trailer. It provided no coverage from the elements and no security for storage overnight, which limited us to 1 day events. This is why, we are asking for your help, one more time.  All of the events that we have been invited to in 2017 are multi-day events ranging from two days to six days long.We are looking to purchase a simple, 6x12 enclosed trailer with a ramp door. This would enable us to transport our equipment and supplies across the highways and byways in a safe and secure manner, keeping everything protected from the weather and would enable us to work multiple day events, resulting in more sales which means more veterans going to Washington, D.C.The average price in West Michigan for the trailer we would need, is approximately $3500.  As low as that cost is to some, it is an expense that we cannot afford at this time. We need your help. Izzy's Lemon Aid was created in 2014 by Isabella ""Izzy"" Grimes. At age 6, Izzy wanted to do the typical ""Summertime Lemonade Stand"" that most kids do at her age...but there was a twist. She wanted to use her profits to support a local charity. After careful thought, she chose a local law enforcement charity dedicated to helping the families of law enforcement officers and firefighters in times of need. She helped her dad design and build her first lemonade stand ""Izzy's Buzzy Bee Cafe"". Izzy didn't want to serve regular lemonade, she wanted it to be the best tasting stuff she ever had; Lemon Shake-Ups! After carefully approaching a local bank manager, she was allowed to set up in front of the bank on their customer appreciation day. In short, Izzy was able to bring in over $100 in 4 hours! After getting home, she counted the money and looked up at her father and casually said ""This isn't enough money. We need to find a way to make more so we can help more people."" With that simple, honest, and selfless statement, Izzy's Lemon Aid was born.Izzy and her dad decided the best way to maximize their donations was to sell more lemonade. The best way to do this, was to attend bigger events, festivals, shows, etc. with more people. Izzy's Lemon Aid is now a mobile food vending operation with a 10' x 10' canopy tent, full color banners, and NSF Approved equipment.￼￼Veterans Suprise Izzy at her school for her effortswww.izzyslemonaid.com",https://images.gofundme.com/e9Ag8ERlIHOkUKDL6V1JMF4k9oE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17195002_1483571466.9887.png,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Daniel Grimes is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jasmine Cloud.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$3,555 raised of $3,500 goal"

The plan was to go back next week to my family in The Netherlands, January 11th. However, the dogs desperately still need extra help and I would love to continue my work as a volunteer at GDS. So when I will be in Holland next week, I would be so happy if I could prepare my trip back to GDS somewhere mid-February. However, due to the fact that I have been here for three months and therefore having no source of income as a volunteer. So unfortunately I cannot afford the costs for the flight and everything myself. So for that reason I would like to ask you if there is any opportunity to help me with this fund and allow me continuing doing something which I am very passionate about! With this fund I hope, with all my heart, that I will be able to come back here at GDS mid-February to continue my work. I find it very, very difficult to ask for help like this, but with the thought that I am doing this just for the welfare of the dogs, I will give it a try. The dogs are my life and that’s all there is to it.I cannot express in words how important this is to me and how grateful I would be. So I would like to say thank you so much in advance and of course I will keep you informed about everything.Would you please be so kind to help me anyway you can and anyway you want to?I really do appreciate this more than I can ever express.

She is a very hard worker, extremely conscientious, always up early, does everything she is asked to do, never complains and even does jobs she isn't asked to do, if she sees it needs to be done she does it. She's been taking some great photos which helps us promote the dogs on the webpage and FB and is now starting to help me take video.

In late October I got ill with what I thought was the flu, but within two days I could tell it was something much worse. I ended up spending a few weeks in the hospital with severe pneumonia in both lungs and a blood infection. Since being released from the hospital I have been on constantly changing antibiotics, inhalers, pain meds, and constant doctors appointments, lab tests, and blood draws. One lung has shown improvement, but the other has not. The Pulmonologist had ordered a procedure to figure out what exactly is growing in my lungs, but insurance has denied the necessary prerequisite CT Scan because I have had too many already. My medical bills have topped the $100K mark, and while insurance will cover a bunch of that it is a new year and will once again have to meet my deductible. I have been unable to work, as I can not breathe, am running a constant fever, and suffer terrible vertigo. I have been receiving short term disability, but it is not much, and I have no idea when I will be receiving it, or when they will cut it off.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/u9-love-and-prayers-for-whitley,❤️️Love and Prayers for WHITLEY❤️️,"Dearest family, friends, and prayer warriors, First, let us extend our thanks to everyone for all their love, support, and prayers at this most difficult time. We could not have made it this far without you! But now more than ever, we need you all! On December 21, 2016, Whitley went in for a tonsilectomy due to her repeated strep throat and abscesses that even antibiotics could not help. On December 24, 2016, she was rushed to the hospital via ambulance with trouble breathing, very low blood pressure, and increased heart rate. She was admitted into ICU with septic shock. While being treated for septic shock, she became acidic and then developed ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) By 3am Christmas morning she was sedated, intubated, and placed on a ventilator to help her with her breathing. On December 27th, Whitley was transferred to Emory University Hospital via airplane and then placed on an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) in the CVICU. Her doctors did this in hopes that it would give her lungs some time to rest and to heal, but by December 30, after brain scans were performed, we were told Whitley had suffered a stroke(s) and that if she did wake, she would not be functional. She now has limited time on the ECMO, due to discontinued use of heparin because of her brain bleed. It is our hope and we do pray that Whitley will defy the odds as she has so many times in her short life! She has already shown signs of normal brain function!

Randy and I have been going on North Texas Toy Runs for 25 plus years. I am trying to help obtain a goal of $10,000.00 just to help with medical cost that his family is incuring. Randy was on the way December 10th to meet us at Mavrick HD to ride for the Scottish Rite Hospital run, which was going to end up at Strokers Dallas. Randy crashed on the way to meet us and was taken to Methodist Hospital in Dallas. He has been there with neck surgeries and multiple problems, and is partialy paralized at this time. He is in Rehab and trying to gain some mobility so he can go home. But there is still no time frame as to when that will happen. His wife Alice has been by his side the whole time and is sleeping at the Hospital on an air mattress in case he needs anything. She has only left him to go home and shower and take care of his dog.I remember one year Randy by himself raised over 75 coats for the Denton County Coats for Kids Run. He has always tried to make as many Toy Runs every year that he could. His motorcycle was totaled in the accident also, and  he is not getting paid for time off of work. If at all possible please donate what you can for a guy that really needs help, and also for a friend that is always there when anyone needs anything. I have set a small goal to reach and please share and pass this on to everyone you know.Randy has been in the HVAC Industry for over 30 years with me.

The long and short of it is after some pain and a trip to the emergency room he had his tests moved to the day after his hospital visit and they found a tumor on him. He went and saw the specialist the next day and was told he needs surgery right away to remove the tumor and give him the best chance of the cancer not spreading to other parts of his body. The doctor has let him know he will be off work for a minimum of 6-8 weeks and that time period could end up becoming longer based on what kind of post surgery therapy (ie. chemo or radiation) he may have to undergo.With this coming out of nowhere and being right after the holidays Grayson isn't in a position to be able to afford his living expenses or pay for whatever type of prescriptions he may be given, as well as any other costs that may arise. Grayson is too proud to ask for help but with some persuading we convinced him that in this situation he needs to accept that there are others out there that want to help him through this tough time. If his close friends and family could do it ourselves we would as he doesn't necessarily want to tell everyone that he is going through this but he needs the help right now and everything is appreciated. Please take the time to read this and share it, if you can donate, it is more appreciated than you could imagine; everything helps. All we want for Grayson is for him to get better and not have to worry about paying for his three kids (Makenna, Theo and Cadence) and his own expenses while he is trying to get better.

Children are extremely vulnerable to gangs and mischief-makers in this window.   Countless studies show a link between exposure to violence in the community and symptoms of aggressive behavior, depression, and anxiety in school-age children living in violent urban neighborhoods. Studies of school-age children exposed to violence via social media and television have also recognized adverse effects over time. When children don’t succeed, it enforces the cycle of poverty and crime in a neighborhood.  Englewood is rising up and taking itself back – and you can help! In 2003 Teamwork Englewood was formed to raise up the community with a Quality of Life Plan. There are a number of grass roots organization contributing to this effort and “LaTanya and the Youth of Englewood” is one of them.  LaTanya Johnson started this organization on her own and has been working out of the basement of the local YMCA.  Her program works with youth ages 5 to 13 to provide after school activities including recreation, education, communication skill building, social opportunities, advocacy and support. Most importantly, this protective program provides strong relationships with a capable, caring, and positive adults – a key component of helping children cope and succeed in this dangerous and violent environment.   She is currently serving 25 kids with a program from 6-8 pm, and hopes to expand to 100 kids and extend the hours to 4-8 pm.  She needs your help.Homegrown leadership – a message from LaTanya... I grew up in the poverty of Englewood. I understand the problems families face.  I vowed to help lift children out of this under resourced existence. I know how to reach these children, as well as engage parents in their child's wellbeing.  I am well respected by the leaders and citizens of this community for my character and my capacity for uplifting, guiding and advocating for the youth.  Having a daughter of Englewood initiate and run this afterschool program is inspirational and motivating for everyone in the community.  As poor as the kids in my program are, I insist they learn community service and we regularly feed and help the homeless and hurting in our neighborhoods.  The kids and I also ran in The Englewood ""Ditch the Guns and Weight"" 5K for the last two years! Please help me make a difference in my community and in the lives of these children.Sincerely, LaTanya JohnsonFounder of “LaTanya and the Youth of Englewood”",https://images.gofundme.com/ZoKgHWj7UailEuLx9zxjvPuGLoc=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17195866_1483919730.2237.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Johnson Latanya is organizing this fundraiser.,Community & Neighbors,"$6,526 raised of $15,000 goal"

We appreciate your love, prayers and words of hope during this time.I know Angela is passionate about bringing awareness to Ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer. Please remember...They go so undetected. There is no screening for these cancers like breast cancer. They call it the silent killer. These cancers are very rare but some of the symptoms are: bloating, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, urgency to urinate, feeling full really quickly after eating. Be in tuned with your body. Think outside the bra and get a thorough exam on your pelvic region. Any woman over the age of 35, should be getting a rectal-vaginal exam. If you are due for your yearly, insist on the proper method in examining your pelvic region. This is the most accurate way to properly examine a woman.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/oneacrefarm,Fund A Permanent Home for My Farm,"Dear Friends of One Acre Farm, As many of you know, we leased our current land 7 years ago from a healthcare organization.  It was always understood that this was not a forever lease, and one day we would have to begin the process of moving the farm again.  That day has come.  We have been told that since the completion of the Cabin Branch Outlet Mall, the land that we have been farming organically to support our CSA has attracted significant interest including offers to purchase.  We’ve also been told that upon acceptance of an offer, it is likely to take up to two years to close on the loan (for permitting/surveying/etc.).  To our knowledge, an offer has not yet been accepted. However, realistically, this also means that our best case scenario is no more than 2 years on the current land and, as a result, we only have that amount of time (+/- 2 years) to find a permanent home for our farm.  I have spent the last 10 years talking with realtors, looking at property and running the numbers on how to afford land in the county that I was born and raised.  Land suitable for farming, within a distance that works for my family is not cheap.  I am at a crossroads, and I am weighing all my options.  Over the last few months I have met with folks in all areas of the farming world, investors, non-profits, government employees, corporations and farmers to try to devise a plan to keep me farming.  The takeaway so far for me is a slight shift in my business model, which I will unveil at a later date, and have begun a fundraising campaign to help secure the necessary funds to secure land.  (https://www.gofundme.com/oneacrefarm)  This is a significant undertaking that I am willing to commit to. That being said, I am also realistic.  I am confident in the terms I am willing to accept to make this work, and pragmatic enough to know when I’m straying too far from my vision to be willing to say this isn’t for me anymore.  Over the next few months, those that are interested in the planning stages of the farm’s next chapter are encouraged to reach out.  I plan on holding a discussion with all interested parties to go over details, ideas, and challenges to try to reach a conclusion that includes land acquisition, a CSA, and a farm to food bank program that expands on our current “Buy-a-Field” campaign.  My vision for this farm has always to be something bigger than just growing vegetables.  It has always been about creating a community.  I encourage anyone interested to join us.",https://images.gofundme.com/jx9oTijCXb1DsqAVxchLbFLGeSY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483561987.0486.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483708336.9149_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483708358.6709_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483708372.0533_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483708397.8057_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483708416.7501_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196134_1483708436.2901_funddescription.jpg']",6,"Created January 4, 2017",Kristin Protas is organizing this fundraiser.,Business & Entrepreneurs,"$2,970 raised of $100,000 goal"

We need your help in paying for Molly’s second Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO) Surgery.I really wish I did not need to ask for help but right now we have no other alternative for our girl Molly. Paul is self-employed trucker and three months ago he was involved in a head on collision. He has been without work this entire time while his truck is being repaired and dealing with the insurance company. Because there is no money coming in we need to ask for your help.Molly underwent her first surgery on her left back leg in February 2016. She needed to undergo a TPLO for a torn ACL. Every time Molly went to stand or put weight on her leg, the femur would slide/rub on the back of the tibia. This rubbing caused pain and inflammation, which was very uncomfortable for her. The total cost for the surgery was $4,215.27. The amount covered the cost for the procedure as well as x-rays, medications and consultations/follow-ups, etc.Molly is once again limping and not walking properly on her other back leg. I just received confirmation yesterday from the veterinarian that she needs to undergo another TPLO. We knew this was going to be a possibility but we hoped we had more time and be in a better place financially to pay for Molly’s surgery.Molly means everything to us and with this surgery she can continue to live a long and happy life. We have never asked for help before but we are desperate and need all the help we can get. A friend of mine suggested this site to us, we would be extremely grateful for any amount we receive.If by chance, we surpass the amount we’re asking then we will donate the rest of the funds to our local SPCA.If you are skeptical or require additional information or copies of her previous surgery I would be more than happy to provide that to you.Thank youMolly, Paul and Charlene* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * *   Bonjour à tous. Mon conjoint Paul et moi avons besoin de votre aide. Nous cherchons des fonds pour payer la deuxième chirurgie de l'Ostéotomie de nivellement du plateau tibial (TPLO) de Molly.Je regrette d’être dans une telle situation, mais en ce moment nous n'avons pas d'autre solution pour notre fille Molly que de demander votre aide. Paul est un camionneur indépendant et il y a trois mois, il a été impliqué dans une collision frontale. Il a été sans travail tout ce temps pendant la réparation de son camion et en plus de gérer avec la compagnie d’assurance.Molly a subi sa première chirurgie sur sa jambe arrière gauche en Février 2016. Elle devait subir un TPLO pour un ligament croisé antérieur (LCA) déchiré. Chaque fois que Molly se tenait debout ou mettait du poids sur sa jambe, le fémur glissait/frottait sur le dos du tibia. Ce frottement cause la douleur et l'inflammation, ce qui était très inconfortable pour elle. Le coût total de la chirurgie était de 4 215,27 $. Le montant couvrait le coût de la procédure ainsi que les radiographies, les médicaments et les consultations/suivi, etc.Molly boite de nouveau et ne marche pas correctement sur son autre jambe arrière. Je viens de recevoir la confirmation du vétérinaire qu'elle a besoin un autre TPLO. Nous savions que cela allait être une possibilité, mais nous espérions avoir plus de temps et être dans une meilleure situation financièrement pour payer pour la chirurgie de Molly.Molly est tout pour nous et avec cette chirurgie elle peut continuer à vivre une longue et heureuse vie. Nous n'avons jamais demandé d'aide avant, mais nous sommes désespérés et avons besoin de toute l'aide que nous pouvons obtenir. Une amie m’a suggéré ce site. Nous serions extrêmement reconnaissants pour tout montant que nous recevons.Si par hasard, nous dépassons le montant que nous demandons, nous allons faire un don du reste des fonds à notre SPCA locale.Si vous êtes sceptique ou besoin d'informations supplémentaires ou des copies de sa chirurgie précédente, nous serons plus qu'heureux de vous les fournir.Nous vous remercions,Molly, Paul et Charlene",https://images.gofundme.com/npPQmd1o6DOfGTzYEciHNHjcVbs=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196200_1483718549.1175.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196200_fb_1483564667.5685_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 4, 2017",Charlene Saunders is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$4,550 raised"

The majority of the damage constists of the carport, where Blake Sickler kept his trade tools, the basement, where they had baby supplies stored, and the new born baby's room. On Christmas Eve they welcomed their new baby boy to the world. He was born 3.5 weeks early. Monday (January 2nd) they were able to bring baby home from the NICU at Kadlec.

We appreciate you taking the time to read this post and ask for a donation of whatever you can. Every little bit helps. The money raised through the account will go toward the Sickler family getting back on their feet, along with replunishing all of the baby care supplies that were lost in the fire.  Also helping get Blake's trade tools, so that he can further provide for his family.

He is dependent on multiple anti-convulsing medications to control his seizures and multiple therapies to improve his quality of life including occupational, physical, speech, and behavioral therapies.Hunter requires additional attention due to his health issues, and while Brandy cares for the children and manages the family home, health insurance, medical and developmental resourcing—which in itself is a full time effort—her burden is aggregated by her own recent diagnoses.Brandy has HER2+ Breast Cancer.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kens-financial-war-against-cancer,Ken's financial war against cancer,"First let me start by saying this is something I never thought I'd have to do as I take pride in working hard and being responsible in caring for my family but with great humility I find myself here.2016 started out pretty well for us until midway it came to a crashing halt, just as many of you succumbed to the loss of family members, Ken and I did too.  Ken lost his mother to cancer in July of last year, which devastated him beyound measure, then if that wasn't enough 3 days later had to make an emergency visit to the hospital to be told he had the same cancer he just lost his mother to.   I've heard many stories of this happening to so many other families but you can never be prepared for the overwhelming emotions when it enters your own circle. Ken went through surgery to remove his colon, after a very close call he is still  recovering from this.  A few weeks ago after a 2nd cat scan they found spots on his liver and nodules on his right lung which was not found the 1st time due to acute respiratory failure where the fluid hid this.  Because of this Ken is going through aggressive chemotherapy, which has mulitiple side effects on a daily basis.Emotionally and spiritually we're supporting each other through this as we have good positive days but every now and then it gets a little overwhelming.  I have tried my best to maintain the financial stability for the both of us but In the midst of all this the medical bills are piling up, the mortgage has fallen behind,  I'm going without medication I need to be sure Ken gets his and can have somewhat of a decent day, we're really just struggling to stay afloat at this time, which is why I'm setting up this campaign.  I am not someone who is comfortable with asking for help, I like to be on the other side giving but I was gently reminded that sometimes pride has to be put aside especially for your loved ones sakes.   Prior to Kens diagnosis, Ken had never had difficulty  in his career and had just received a new position within a very reputable company in Engineering but had to decline as his medical condition will no longer allow him to work in this field.  Ken has always provided well for our family and I know it hurts that he can't do it anymore and I know he doesn't like that I now have to put it here. This is our last resort as we have now received a preforeclosure letter from our mortgage company.   We have applied for resources for Ken which has been delayed due to an administrative clerical error within the hospital and was told that the process can be lengthy.  I haven't given up, I'm still fighting for us but feel I've exhausted all other avenues.",https://images.gofundme.com/3D8_VdUlnZNWwWZm4i4peKMMK3U=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196634_1483564158.1381.jpeg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Lana Phifer is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,550 raised of $20,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-dynamic-duo-vs-brain-cancer,The Dynamic Duo vs Brain Cancer,"The Dynamic Duo vs. Brain Cancer.￼I’ve created this page for my amazing cousin Tregg and his 9 year old, super hero son Torey. Torey is an energetic, athletic, smart and witty, giggle box. And I must mention that he gets Straight A’s in school. However we’d soon find out that football, baseball and even school would have to take a back seat to a more pressing issue. On June 24th 2016, Torey began to complain of headaches. His symptoms continued to progress and he became extremely lethargic, sleeping for hours on end. This is when his father knew something was truly wrong. He rushed Torey to the emergency room several times only to have him diagnosed with minor ailments and sent back home. Shortly after, Torey began to have difficulty standing on his own and was finally admitted to the Loyola University Medical Center.￼On August 3rd 2016 Torey was diagnosed with Pineoblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer characterized by tumors that grow on the brain at a rapid rate. A CT revealed that a tumor had developed and was creating a fluid called hydrocephalus on Torey’s brain and spinal cord, causing his lethargy and immobility. Torey had emergency surgery to drain the fluid and a second surgery on August 18th to remove the tumor. Days after surgery, the family waited on pins and needles after being informed that Torey’s vision may have been compromised but our super hero fought and his vision was completely restored.￼Torey underwent some chemotherapy to ensure the cancer was completely gone and he was back home and selected to pitch the first pitch at the White Sox game. He was elated. This was a dream come true for him since before the cancer, Torey was selected to play in the All-Star game for his baseball little league. He drilled that ball right down the center! It was amazing! Unfortunately, that sublime feeling was short lived. On September 21, 2016, Torey reported to the hospital after having multiple seizures. Tregg was told that the seizures were a result of two new tumors that had developed on Torey’s brain. With concerns of another surgery being too invasive, doctors felt it was best to have Torey undergo chemotherapy daily for 6 weeks and a few times a month thereafter.My cousin Tregg is the laughter and heartbeat of our family. Even as he goes through, what is undoubtedly the toughest chapter of his life, he seemingly remains light hearted. I ask him how he’s holding up and his reply is always one of hope and positivity. I ask him if he needs anything and his reply is always “your prayers are enough.” His employer has been gracious enough to allow him time off to care for Torey. His parents, brother and girlfriend have been an invaluable support. Even with this, I know that the cross he bares is one far too heavy for a 30 year old, single father to carry. I know Tregg is sincere when he tells me my prayers are enough, but I believe God often answers prayers when we least expect it.I ask, if you feel compelled, that you please assist in helping Tregg and Torey in this arduous battle. Torey has his father’s strength and I have faith that this dynamic duo will triumph over cancer! But even the greatest super heroes need help. I am hoping to raise 10k to help with bills and daily living expenses. We will get through this and beat cancer! Torey’s strength has inspired us all to keep fighting.￼￼￼",https://images.gofundme.com/eQzkTlxACzYeGNN6mVInThicqY0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17196708_1483564526.5308.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Jasmine Boone is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Tregg Boone.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,530 raised of $10,000 goal"

Throughout her life she has endured many health challenges in which she's conquered all with grace. PH, lupus, nor scleroderma could hold her down. She's a Survivor!In June 2011, LaVonda was blessed to become a recipient of a bilateral lung transplant. Remarkably, she's managed to reach the 5 year survivor mark. Although, there have been minor setbacks, her will to make positive changes within her life has never changed. Her spirits are upbeat and impressive.Unfortunately, LaVonda has been faced with new, harsh complications. Since July 2016, LaVonda noticed small changes in her respiratory health that caused her to monitor her activities. Well as the months moved forward, she had experienced a considerable decline in lung functioning. This lead to multiple hospital stays before the year ended.Currently, LaVonda is on a strict diet. Due to lung rejection, she's unable to ingest food and depends on nutrients from a feeding tube. She also relies on concentrated oxygen to participate in daily activities because breathing doesn't come so naturally.LaVonda has decided to seek medical treatment that will potentially prolong her life and to give her Life. She's in the process of being assessed by various transplants clinics across the country for re-transplant. Until she's placed on a transplant list, she and her family will incur many expenses (travel, lodge, food, uninsurable medical needs, etc.). When transplanted, she will be required to live at least 3 months in that particular city.The motto that LaVonda lives by is ""Quality over Quantity"". So, if you can, please donate to this fund.

Thank you for your help!Update 1:We have already sent my mother to WY and are hoping that the money we raise here will keep her in WY for the 90 days. She is currently living in a home that takes week to week payments. We have quickly maxed out credit cards, savings, and family support. We are relying completely on this fund to keep Pamela in WY so she can get the help she needs. My grandmother is staying with her to keep her safe, fed, and take her to necessary appointments. This has required plane tickets, car rental, and a place to stay that is equiped to meet my mothers disability needs. All of this means we could not put her up in a cheaper hotel, but we had to purchase a rental. Please help us keep my mom in WY so she can get the help she so desperately needs.My mother Pamela was in a serious car accident in September of 2004 and suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), partial paralysis of her left arm and leg, and partial blindness. Because of these injuries, she requires assistance with nearly everything and around the clock care. Life has been quite trying for our family during this time. Which we have recently discovered, is quite common for families such as ourselves. TBI isolates families from the rest of society in a way that is impossible to describe. People don't really want to hear that life can be so difficult 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, month after month, and year after year. Its troublesome for the mind to comprehend the difficulty of some experiences. There is no blame that can be laid at my father's feet. He has done his very best under impossible odds, almost to his own ruin, and the ruin of his family. My father has spent 13 years trying to find the silver lining, look at the glass half full, and work on solutions to keep my mother with us. It hard to accept the fact that the best hope of being a forever family is to remove its heart, our mother, and place it in the care of others. It runs so counter the family oriented faith we have grown up in, to break up our family, that we suffer almost equally in our solution as we have in our challenge. I know this has been a daily challenge for my father every day of the last 13 years, to justify placing my mother in another's care. To separate his beloved wife from (as my mother exclaims) ""her precious children."" I would like to give him what aid I can.Our family recently discovered an affordable care option in Buffalo, WY called the Beehive House. This facility is perfect for Pamela, they have a lot of experience catering to the needs of traumatic brain injury survivors. However, in order to afford this option, my mother has to apply and become eligible for Wyoming Medicaid.Why Wyoming? Just because you qualify for aid does not mean there are facilities with vacancies available. All over the nation there are more qualified needy people than facility vacancies available. Finding a place where you can qualify for aid AND find an opening in an accepting facility is very difficult. We have found both aid and availability in Wyoming.As of now we have begun the process applying for WY Medicaid and other health waivers, for which Pamela qualifies. Paper work and the government do not mix. There will be a waiting period of 90 days before Pamela can be placed in an assisted living care facility. But she must continue to be a WY resident during that time. We do not have the money to keep my mother in WY for 90 days.We have diligently searched for other options but this one is the most pragmatic given the circumstances and our timeline.Any help you could provide for my mother at this time is greatly appreciated and much needed.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/jeffs-hospital-bill,Jeffs hospital bill,"￼On Christmas morning Jeff started having some chest pain which we thought might just be from nerves since we were on our way to the airport to go to Colorado. When we got to DC (after our plane was delayed for an hour) the pain was worse and he was having a hard time breathing. He was having the symptoms of a heart attack so I found an airplane maintenance guy who called the paramedics up for us. After hooking him up to an EKG machine and finger sensor they said his heart was fine and his o2 level was a little low probably due to poor finger circulation. They told him it was probably just anxiety and to relax and drink some booze and he was ok to fly. After getting in the air the pain was excruciating and it was even harder to breathe and he was stuck in a hunched over position for the whole 4 hour flight. After landing and it not getting any better we took him to the ER and they rushed him back to get X-rays. As soon as the dr saw the X-ray they rushed him into the OR (without telling him what was going on) to insert a tube into his chest cavity. Then the dr told him his lung had collapsed and filled his chest with so much air that it was pushing his lungs and heart over to the left so far and he was minutes from going into cardiac arrest. The pulmonologist called it a spontaneous pneumothorax. Basically there was no real reason it happened. Your lung can form bubbles and when they pop it forms a hole and your lung collapses. They got him up to a room where they monitored his lung for two days and then clamped the vacuum tube to see if his lung would stay inflated on its own. The next morning a X-ray showed his lung had collapsed again over night. He went into surgery where they did a partial pleurectomy- removed part of the chest cavity lining, and did a pleurodesis- basically ""glued"" his lung to his ribs so it couldn't collapse again. Two days later everything looked good so he was released from the hospital and we were able to go home. Good news is there is only a 5% chance of this happening again in that lung. Bad news, there's a 40% chance of it happening in the other lung and in probably a couple weeks from now we'll get a letter from the hospital saying we owe them a small fortune. Anything anyone can give us will be greatly appreciated! FYI8% of your donation is deducted so if you want to do it another way just let me know.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/highwaychildrenfilm,Highway Children: A Student Film,"Logline:Two teenaged runaways are faced with the dangerous reality of the real world when their desperation to find a way to shower leads them to a seedy motel in the wrong side of town.Director’s Statement:         “Highway Children” introduces us to two sixteen-year-old runaways, Alex and Katie, as they navigate a way to simply find a shower in the midst of their exhausting journey. As the story progresses, we learn more about these two characters and their relationship with one another; lost souls, escaping the perils of their home lives and seeking solace in their now isolated relationship. I wrote this script a few years ago as a short film to introduce a possible full-length feature. It’s an exaggerated version of a chapter in my own life, where I ran away with my high school boyfriend, only to find that life on the road did not prove to be any easier than the issues he and I were made to deal with at home. I wanted to bring this story to life because I think it’s important to acknowledge the unquenched thirst for an independent life so many teenagers feel as they reach the brink of adulthood. Consequently, this desperation to be freed can easily pave the way to the delusion that ignoring reality is the solution to finding your place in the world.          Alex and Katie are met with a classic fight or flight situation in this story when Katie’s type-A personality leads them to a risky and potentially fatal situation. Alex, our thoughtful and careful protagonist, feels he has no choice but to take the back seat in their journey but quickly finds his strength when Katie’s tough girl façade rapidly humbles in the face of real world danger. His character experiences dramatic changes from fearful, to displaced anger, and finally unexpected heroism. He’s chosen a vagabond existence with Katie over the comfort of a suburban lifestyle and it frees a shackled part of him he never realized he was capable of.          When writing this script, I wanted to make sure that I not only taught a lesson of caution, but told a story of how love, especially a first love, can make you feel like anything is possible. How devoting your entire being to someone else is not only exciting but can also create a sense of invincibility in an otherwise unlikely person. “Highway Children” is a story about perseverance when you choose to throw it all away in the hope of gaining it all.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-my-grandchildren-back-home,Bring my grandchildren back home,"My 3 oldest grandchildren have been taken out of their home state without court permission by their father and his wife. Many of you already know that my grandchildren have been gone from us for over two years. They have not been allowed any contact with their mother, their 2 younger siblings, or any member of their family including myself. Their whereabouts have been kept from every family member and keeping track of them was difficult due to their changing residences and schools 3 times since being taken from my home, their home, in October 2014. There have been no pictures, phone calls or any reassurance of their wellbeing offered until the time he was leaving the state, and they have been under the purposeful misconception that we just did not care about them and were not looking for them. This is a psychologically cruel action to inflict on young children and is known as alienation in a court of law. It has recently come to light that they are not ""thriving"" in their current situation, and one of them is presently hospitalized, although we are told she is ""safe"". They're  currently under the watch of County Family Services with abuse allegations pending investigation. After trying to seek help from many resources, I contacted a States Attorney who has offered to take this case for their mother and myself for a comparatively low retainer fee of $1,500. He believes the children should know the security and love of the family they were taken from and that it is detrimental to the well-being of any child to not be allowed the love of their mother and the family they were raised with; that being told to run and scream if they ever see us, or being denied a phone call and then being punished for asking, are alienation tactics that are very damaging to children, because regardless of how a parent may feel about the other, the child still loves that parent and does not want to hear negative things.  Imagine, though it's hard, having a child you love suddenly torn from your life and being left with nothing but their sweet memories. It's got a name, Living Grief. Imagine being told that they are sick and then not being able to comfort them or not being allowed any information on their condition. Imagine that the child or children you hold so dear to your heart are being told terrible and untrue things about you, and being forced to choose who they love more, or forced not to mention feelings about you at all. I am asking for you, my dear friends and family, to please reach deep down inside of your hearts and help us with some of the expenses for this attorney so we may retain him by next Wednesday, and give these children the knowledge that they were not forsaken, and are very much loved and painfully missed. Let them know we never stopped caring and no one wanted it to be this way. Give these precious young lives a voice without fear of consequences for expressing their truest and deepest feelings. Let them have their day in the safety and presence of train professionals who will help them express their true feelings so that they may begin to mend and help them to trust their world again. Any amount will be helpful, I know times are hard and it's right after Christmas. I know it is short notice, I was not expecting such a quick call back, but things do happen for a reason.We are in desperate need of help from caring and compassionate people to do whatever they are able to help ensure these children have a fair shake at life. It is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in asking for help, but I will do whatever I need to help give these three really awesome children what they deserve; for them to know that they are loved and wanted by us, the other half of who they are, their family. And I just cannot do it on my own,Thank you so much for taking the time to read this story, it means so much to me and their mother and family to know we have a chance at having them back in our lives and will be able to give their little brother and sister their best buddies back.With much gratitude and deepest appreciation,Eileen E.

My friend Jody Davis, despite being kind, generous, helpful, and good, has had more unfortunate occurrences in her life than either I or Jody's friends can account for. It has reached the point where we fear asking her how she is, because inevitably, something new has gone wrong. Just recently, she stood by her front door and put her key in the lock. At that moment, the gutter above fell on her head. A few months ago, a bleed in her right eye led to near blindness in that eye. Sadly, that is only part of the problem. She has macrodegeneration in both eyes (not a good condition for an avid quilter to have) as well as other medical problems that require close monitoring. Fortunately, she receives shots in her eyes that allow her to continue to see. Jody never complains. She maintains a positive attitude always.Jody is the pillar of her family, ever there with words of comfort and a willing hand. Her family members have also traveled some rough roads, and Jody lifts them up and helps them heal, forgetting her own needs. Her friends receive the same treatment. For years and years Jody has driven an unreliable clunker with a big dent in the side and a broken-off rear view mirror. She has replaced just about every part of that car, once having to refinance her house in order to fix it because she had no money for a new one. Consequently, each time she has been able to build up savings, something goes wrong with the car, and out come the funds. We feel that if Jody did not have the burden of a junker car, she'd be able to put aside funds for emergencies and wouldn't be afraid of her car falling apart at any moment.Most of Jody's friends are retired teachers, who can offer some money but not enough to fund a car. We don't want Jody's replacement car to look as if it just finished the demolition derby. We want her to have a good, reliable vehicle so she can be her independent self we so admire. $15,000 should get her a decent one.All Jody's friends and I will be so thankful for anyone who decides to contribute to this wonderful woman's cause. She's a person who never asks for anything, does not expect anything, but certainly deserves the best of everything--though she hardly ever gets it.We hope to reach our goal by 3/15/17.Thank you so much for reading this and helping to fund Jody Davis's new car.",https://images.gofundme.com/AUHWqvVintc4j5jZjp7Wr5nb-Uw=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17197572_1483565878.1338.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Margot Gamash McDonnell is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"$1,765 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/davids-medical-trip-fund,David's Medical Trip Fund,"We are asking for donations to make it possible for us to take our son David to Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan for a second opinion with a surgeon who specializes in David's rare lung condition. The plan is to have his lung removal surgery there. This will require at least 2 trips to Michigan. We will have to drive each time because David's pulmonologist said that his lungs are too fragile to safely fly in an airplane. The funds raised will help cover the costs of travel and the portions of medical expenses that insurance won't cover.David was born 3 months early in May despite his due date being in August. His twin brother had passed away in utero a month prior to his birth. David weighed only 2 lbs and 6 oz.!David faced a lot of issues right after birth. The NICU team had to resuscitate him. When they got him up to the NICU, they learned that he had a collapsed lung on the right and had to place a chest tube that would be there for a few days. He also was intubated and on a ventilator. On his fourth day of life, they gave us some horrible news, David had bleeding in his brain. They offered for us to take him off of life support and make him comfortable until he passed or to allow him to continue on. My husband and I had no doubt in our mind that we were going to keep him alive and provide him the best life possible. They told us that David could turn out anywhere from a blind and deaf in a vegetative state to just needing minor help in school, or anywhere in between.We faced a long road from there! They noticed on his chest x-rays that there was something wrong with the left upper lobe in his lung. When he was finally stable enough, they did a CT scan of his lungs. This is when his congenital lung problem was found. He had what is called Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM). It is an extremely rare condition and is essentially a large cyst or multiple small cysts within the lung. David has a whole bunch of cysts, probably close to 30! We were told by the NICU doctors and a pediatric surgeon who was consulted on it that he would eventually need that part of his lung removed. In the meantime, David still continued to fight for his life in the NICU. His brain bleed did not resolve on its own and it caused hydrocephalus. We were told that once he reached 2 kg in weight (double his birth weight) then he would need surgery to place a VP shunt. In the meantime the started with doing spinal taps to relieve brain pressure until he could no longer tolerate them (it was a huge set back, back on the ventilator and very critical condition) where they switched to doing fontanelle taps in the soft spot on his head. He even started having seizures as a result of the pressure.On July 6 (his big sister's first birthday), he underwent brain surgery to have his shunt placed. A device he would need for the rest of his life and brings it's own risks of infection at any point or failure. He had complications from the surgery and was back to being in critical condition for a few days.He slowly started to get better and improved. The only area he struggled in was feeds. As it got closer to his due date the doctors mentioned the possibility of needing a g-tube for him to go home on so he could be fed enough formula. On August 8, David underwent surgery to have his g-tube placed. He recovered well from that and daddy and I needed to learn how to use the g-tube.On August 15, I was over the moon excited to be able to bring him home! After 96 long days in the NICU, David no longer needed to be in the hospital! It was not the end of his problems though. He has had to be seen by an ophthalmalogist, pulmonolgist, G-I doctor, cardiologist, neurosurgeon, and pediatric surgeon on top of his normal pediatrician.  He has since been cleared from needing to see the cardiologist but still see all the other specialists. He also receives physical therapy to help him improve on his motor skills. He will soon be seeing an occupational therapist and is taking a break away from his speech therapist for a little while.His pediatric surgeon who has been following him for his CCAM has told us that he will need the left upper lobe of his lung removed at some point over the next few years. We have to find a delicate balance between letting David get big enough, strong enough, and healthy enough for the surgery but also not waiting to long as it has the potential to turn into cancer. We want to take David to a bigger hospital that has a lot more experience with this condition for a second opinion and eventual surgery. We want the second opinion to make sure we are doing exactly what he needs but to also make sure it is done by a surgeon that does more than 1 a year if they are lucky and at a hospital that has a post-op care team that knows what to expect during his recovery phase.With me being a stay at home mom with David, the trip will be extremely difficult for us to afford.

He was an amazing young man who touched many lives through his compassion, positive attitude, words of wisdom, unconditional love, willingness to lend a helping hand and acts of kindness.  Miles left this world much too soon, however, the impact he made was great.  Miles dreamt big and had a caring and giving spirit. He gave of himself in ways that made our world nicer, kinder, more beautiful, peaceful and loving.   Miles was positive, upbeat and refused to let anyone around him feel down or depressed.  He always had a hug, encouraging word or thoughtful deed to help anyone in need.  His unforgettable smile and great personality lit up the room the moment he entered it.  Miles had an ability to make every person in his life feel as if they were the most important person in his life.  Smart, gifted and talented, Miles could always be counted on to encourage and motivate others to dream big and to passionately pursue their dreams.   Miles believed in life’s possibilities and that great things were possible for anyone. In honor of Miles, our mission is to carry his loving and giving spirit forward.  Education is a gift that lasts a lifetime. Through donations which were given in lieu of flowers at Miles’ funeral and in recognition of his birthday (July 28th, which was two weeks after he passed), we were able to assist four 2016 high school graduates with their college expenses.   Our goal is to grow and continue this endeavor. Through this scholarship fund, we will honor Miles’ legacy by actively helping students in need pursue their educational goals.  Our goal is to create an ongoing scholarship fund that touches the world by helping students in need pursue their dreams, reach their full potential and reach out to help someone else in need to do the same. Though we still do not understand why such a beautiful soul as Miles left us so soon, we-his family and friends, endeavor to focus on his life which touched so many, and on the legacy he left us.   We want everyone to know about Miles, to understand how special he was and to understand why we must keep his spirit alive; Miles' dreams must be fulfilled, tragically not by him, but rather through helping others reach their dreams.",https://images.gofundme.com/-K5tfHrFfNBC77Y1lhJcnPkdNxM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17197892_1483580345.4342.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Gwendolyn Burton is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$3,986 raised of $10,000 goal"

In 2010, he decided to take his health and the health of his community into his own hands and “Plant Some Shit”, turning a strip of city-owned land into a food oasis. After a citation, fine and eventual warrant for Finley’s arrest over the grass that he transformed into a food forest for his community, word spread quickly about the “Gangsta Gardener”.With the help of his powerful 2013 Ted Talk and 2015 film ""Can You Dig This"", his message that gardens are solutions to inner city health problems, gang violence and poverty has echoed around the world. The ringing of his words has given birth to urban communities across the globe coming together to grow their own food in areas that have none.People from all walks of life have shown their support for Finley's efforts. Luminaries such as René Redzepi, Russell Brand, Alice Waters, Rainn Wilson, Penny Marshall, Aloe Blacc, Carson Daley, Rachel Hunter and Robert Horry have reached out in solidarity, as well as statewide dignitaries including Mayors Aja Brown, Kevin Johnson and Councilman Herb Wesson. Over the years, the Gangsta Garden has evolved into more than a symbol of healthy change for urban communities including an educational site, a propagation station for more edible landscapes and the formal headquarters for The Ron Finley Project (RFP). Furthermore, it has become the focus of study for local K-12 classrooms and universities worldwide including the renown institutions of MIT, Harvard and University of Southern California. Currently, RFP is fighting for their headquarters; the very same location that ignited a good food revolution when Finley took back city land and planted the seeds to cultivate happy and healthy communities. After numerous attempts by the property owner for a loan modification with no avail, the land was sold to Strategic Acquisitions Inc in a foreclosure.RFP has requested that Strategic Acquisitions allow them to continue operating from the location as to sustain the important work they are doing in the community. The only solution they have been offered is to purchase the property for $500,000, otherwise... they face eviction.Finley took on city lawmakers in 2010 sparking a worldwide food justice revolution. Now the world needs to rally behind him!RFP needs to raise $500,000 to #savethegangstagarden.

He wants to help everyone affected by this disease to understand and accept, instead of rejecting and hiding from it in shame and fear. As my dad has said, ""It is out of our control but we can manage this disease, still live with enjoyment, ADVENTURE and love. My dad is an inspiration to me. My passion for motorsports, the outdoors, and adventure come from him. So, what better way to keep the ADVENTURE going than for us to take a memorable 10-day tour of Washington state this summer in a motorcycle side car. We will depart for this trip July 4th from Twisp, WA, during the town's annual Independence day parade. We will make stops in Bellingham, Seattle, Olympia, Yakima, Spokane and finish at Pybus Market in Wenatchee, WA. In each of these communities, we will attend an organized Alzheimer rally where families and those living with Alzheimers can gather to help spread awareness and help find an end to Alzheimer's. Together, riding side by side around the state, my dad and I will make a powerful statement about pursuing life with Alzheimer's, the opportunities open to everyone affected by the disease and the importance of living an enjoyable and respected life. Help us make this journey of a lifetime possible! We need funds for hospitality, fuel (for our bellies and bike) and to assist with media support.  Any love and support we can get will be greatly appreciated. Money raised over our goal will be donated to the Washington State Alzheimer's Association.Please see the Reddington Project, Living with Alzheimers, a story about my dad: https://issuu.com/methowvalleypublishing/docs/livingwithalzheimers",https://images.gofundme.com/ERaWeStIVK-uHzK-qVLGFn9Z_-E=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17198540_1483571199.9944.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17198540_1485714837.9773_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17198540_1485714775.588_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17198540_1487276051.4714_funddescription.jpg']",3,"Created January 4, 2017",Donni Reddington is organizing this fundraiser.,Travel & Adventure,"$6,670 raised of $7,500 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/frank-perri-medical-fund,Frank Perri Medical Fund,"Hello everyone, Our very good friend Frank Perri travelled from Sault Ste. Marie to Toronto on December 20, 2016 for surgery to remove his esophagus which was performed on December 21, 2016. He was diagnosed with Achalasia and removal was the only option. For years he has been having trouble eating and swallowing food to the point where the food was not digesting and his body was not getting the nutrients that he needed. Even though the surgery was 9 hours long it was considered relatively routine. Unfortunately it was anything but routine. During the course of two surgeries one of Frank's vocal chords was left paralyzed, his stomach and what was left of his esophagus became twisted and ripped and a major artery was nicked and blood clots formed in his chest cavity near his lungs. He is in stable but serious condition. He has lost over twenty pounds and is being fed through a tube in his neck. He is not even allowed to drink water. Frank will not be coming home for at least a month but even that is optimistic.  Frank is a social worker for the Ministry of Corrections, a doting father of three kids under the age of 11 and a loving husband to Terri. Terri does not have a job because she is legally blind and has been by his bedside the entire time in Toronto, with her service dog Haley. Terri's Mother and Sister have been taking care of their three  children in the meantime. They miss their Mom and Dad very much. She will stay with Frank until he is well enough to return home. This whole ordeal has put a great emotional strain on him and his family as I'm sure most of you can imagine. Their time away from home has been and will be much longer than originally anticipated and has become a great financial strain on the family as well. I ask everyone if you can see fit to donate whatever you can to Frank and Terri and their kids during this time of need. The money will be used for bills such as hotel stay for Terri as she is not allowed to stay at the Hospital as well as food, airfare and everyday needs for her and their children. I thank you for taking the time to read this page and God bless!SincerelySandy Lucio",https://images.gofundme.com/-OeJhMigyFN7f45HeTEXJX7imjk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17198580_1483567169.5007.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Sandy Lucio is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"$30,215 raised of $30,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gracieinthailand,My Volunteer Trip to Thailand,"Hi there!   My name is Gracie Cook, a 16-year-old student from Oshawa, Ontario and  as of July 29th 2017, I will be embarking on a 2 week journey in Phang Nga, Thailand, where I will be spending my days volunteering on community development projects, ranging from building schools to painting murals to assisting in child-care centres.  While I’m away, I’ll be living in the local community and exploring the history and culture of Thailand while developing my leadership potential. This trip offers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to experience a completely new and different culture firsthand, while helping people in desperate need. The first week in Thailand is spent volunteering in the local community, doing whatever projects are needed by the partner's at the time. The second week is more focused on cultural exploration, allowing us to experience as much of the Thai culture as possible in our short time away. We visit different islands in southern Thailand, and experience as much of the culture as we can.   I will be travelling with Global Vision International (GVI), an international education organization, that offers a unique two-week community service program that sends high school students to countries such as Thailand, Costa Rica, Nepal, and India. GVI's mission is to operate programs around the world, which offer educational, service and leadership opportunities for young people in order to foster leadership development and global citizenship.I can't even begin to describe my excitement at being accepted into this program, as the group is quite small (around 15 people) and it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me. I've always known that my goal in life is to help others, and this program gives me the opportunity to do so, as well as experience a brand new culture. I may not know exactly what I want to do in my life, but I know that whatever it is I hope I'm helping someone else in any way possible. In Thailand, I want to give children the opportunity to receive a quality education, or give a village clean drinking water that could ultimately save lives. I want to lead by example, and see the goodness in people's hearts. Although I may not have a concrete plan for my future, I know that my experiences in Thailand will give me more knowledge and insight than any classroom ever could, and teach me more about myself than I knew existed. Truthfully, I want to make a difference in the world, whether it be for all 7 billion people, or for one small village. Unfortunately, the cost of this program, not including airfare, is $2461.00, which is a lot of money.  To be able to participate in this program I am fundraising for financial assistance, which I hope you can help provide. I do not want to cause any additional stress, so please do not feel obligated to donate if you are unable. On that note, any and all donations, no matter the amount, are appreciated more than I can express in a letter, because each one brings me one step closer to my dream. All funds I raise will be put towards off-setting the cost of tuition, airfare and any other e xpenses that may arise. Again, I am eternally grateful for any and all donations. At first, the price of travelling seemed too daunting to even consider, but after the support I have already received, I am more excited than ever. Thank you so so much,Gracie",https://images.gofundme.com/jSiNkkS-a84xMMDkusDA7hYZ3Vs=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xk3vr7KLKT8/0.jpg,[],0,"Created February 12, 2017",Gracie Cook is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$2,050 raised"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/vals-medical-mission-in-honduras,Val's Medical Mission in Honduras,"Hi! My name is Valerie Lelle, and I have been volunteering at Hospital Loma de Luz on the North coast of Honduras in Balfate, Colon as a Physician Assistant for the past 3 months. It has been my dream to do medical missions in Latin America since I was 18 years old, and by God's grace, this ambition finally became a reality in October 2016,  which I am so grateful for! I attended Wheaton College from 2009-2013 and Carroll University from 2014-2016for my MPAS degree. The journey was far from easy, but God's helped me through, and I am confident that I am right where He wants me to be- doing what I love, in a place that I love, for a people that I love. I am raising funds to be able to stay in Honduras until the end of 2017 (or longer) to provide medical care, share the gospel of Jesus, and start a soccer ministry while loving and learning from the people of this region.  My financial needs include: rent ($200/month), food ($300/month), electricity ($50/month), gas ($10/month), health insurance ($300/month),  transportation/ travel ($700/ 3-4 months), ministry expenses ($100/month), and personal expenses ($100/month.) To meet these needs thusfar I have been utilizing funds that I earned over the summer working 50+ hrs/week at Chevy Chase Country Club, selling clothing and household items at a garage sale in July, and from a small handful of generous donations from family and friends.I would be extrememly grateful if you chose to partner with me and the ministry at Hospital Loma de Luz in Honduras, as the needs are great and the workers are few.  I understand that financial partnership is not possible for many at this time, but I strongly believe in the power of prayer and community, so if you would committ to praying for me weekly, monthly, or even daily, I know that would make a huge difference in my life and God's work in Honduras.For more information as to how I ended up at Loma de Luz, please read the testimony below. =) May you and your family be very blessed in 2017 and consider being a blessing to others who so desperately need it!-----------------------------------------------------------------------How did I get here?In December 2010 I attended the Passion Conference in Atlanta, Georgia where I was challenged by speakers including Francis Chan, David Platt, Shane Claiborne, and Louie Giglio to consider what living a radical life for Jesus would really look like. I learned that God has equipped me with specific talents, skills, passions, and abilities and that He has a unique plan and purpose for my life- to serve Him, share the gospel, and bring the Kingdom to earth. I participated in my first short-term missions trip earlier that year in March 2010 with ""Honduras Project"" at Wheaton College. We went to a small rural village in the region of El Paraiso called Buena Vista, where I encountered third-world poverty first-hand for the first time in my life. I was moved to my core by the needs of the people including clean water, healthy food, clothing, education, and healthcare. God instilled in me a yearning to meet these needs and learn from the local Hondurans who had great joy despite their circumstances. I was further challenged by books from the aforementioned authors and speakers to forgo the ""American Dream"" in pursuit of a simple, missional life, and to surrender my future to Jesus and His purpose for me. Passion 2010 is where I first received the call to full-time missions and ministry, and I know that God wants to use me to bring the light of the gospel to dark places in the world with the passions, talents, and gifts He’s given me.After Passion, I changed my major at Wheaton College to Spanish while obtaining science pre-requisites for PA school. I also took several supplemental Bible & Theology courses to grow in my faith and understanding of the gospel so that I could communicate the Good News of Jesus effectively to others. I went on mission trips to Senegal in Africa & Brazil/Paraguay with my soccer team where I experienced missions through a ""sports ministry"" lens and saw how my passion for athletics could be used as a platform to articulate the gospel. I also visited Palestine/Israel in March 2012 for a peace and reconciliation conference where I was abruptly faced with the conflict in the Middle East and the intersection of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. I wrestled with ideas of political and social justice as well as how to best support my Christian Palestinian brothers and sisters, who I still think of and pray for often. I returned to Honduras twice more- in March 2011 with Honduras Project for another water system installation mission trip, this time in a leadership position. In the spring, I applied for a medical/ teaching internship through an organization called Honduras Outreach Inc. in Olancho, Honduras and was accepted. I spent 6 weeks in the Agalta Valley near Juticalpa learning from nurses and doctors in a rural clinic and teaching English to elementary school kids. This past March (2016) I went to Gualán, Zacapa, Guatemala for an international clinical rotation for PA school with two of my classmates through a non-profit called “Hearts in Motion.” We spent the majority of our time in the ER in the city center, learning from the nurses there (who function like doctors) and providing healthcare to members of the surrounding communities. Each time I leave Central America, my heart aches deeply. When I am there, the resounding internal voice of the Spirit reverberates, ""This is home.""  I can’t explain it, but I feel as though all of my passions- Jesus, Spanish, soccer, and helping others through healthcare- line up perfectly to meet the needs of the Latin American populations of the developing world.For years I have sought to discern if my desire to pursue medical missions in Honduras was a selfish one or a true call from the Lord. However, after the Urbana 2015 Conference in St. Louis, MO, I can say with confidence that God is calling me to be full-time missionary in Latin America and that my passion and connection to Honduras comes from Him. Psalm 37:4-6 reads, ""Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your ways to the Lord and He will do this: He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun."" I believe and have heard from several wise mentors that our calling lies at the intersection of our passions, talents, and the needs of the world, that God gives us our dreams and ambitions, and it is up to us to follow Him in radical obedience and to step out in faith no matter what the cost.  If I did not pursue medical missions, but rather, took a position in the United States making $90,000-$120,000/yr and living for myself, not only I would not only be dissatisfied and unfulfilled, I would be behaving disobediently to God. The call to missions, for me, is a persistent feeling I cannot and will not shake; I trust that the desire to serve others in a cross-cultural setting while preaching the gospel comes from God and that He has provided an opportunity for me to respond.   I came across Hospital Loma de Luz in Honduras last summer while researching medical mission opportunities in Honduras through Samartian's Purse World Medical Mission. At the Urbana Conference, I went to the MedicalMission.org tent in the Exhibit Hall and spoke with a kind young man who asked about my story. I told him of my heart for Honduras and desire to pursue medical missions, and he said that he and his wife had recently visited a hospital in Honduras called (you guessed it =)) Loma de Luz. I was elated and told him that was the very hospital where I wanted to serve and had felt God calling me to! He told me that representatives from the hospital were there at Urbana and walked to me their table. I learned that Loma de Luz was owned and operated by the Cornerstone Foundation where I met 2 current missionaries at the hospital and 3 members of the board of directors who listened attentively to my story and said there were certainly opportunities where God could use me at Hospital Loma de Luz. They prayed for me and challenged me to remain obedient to the Lord and earnestly seek His will for my life. I connected with the volunteer coordinator, at the Cornerstone Foundation, a pediatrician at Loma de Luz who also went to Wheaton College and studied Spanish (coincidence? I don't think so... =)) From there, I filled out an application through the Cornerstone Foundation and was accepted to be a long-term volunteer in March 2016.  The past few months have been challenging but rewarding, and I am looking forward to what God is going to do in 2017!",https://images.gofundme.com/7u2AmqdhPoiiOONkyfHWZVnueLs=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17199012_1501740588.4891.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Valerie Lelle is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$5,420 raised of $6,000 goal"

With your help, they will be able deliver this child within their loving home! Evie and Quinn have created a beautiful, kind, brilliantly funny family over the last 15 years. Their children, Quora, Eden, and Coltrane each shine with unfettered spirit of their own individuality, while collectively sharing the values of curiosity, creativity, generousity, and love. They recently purchased their home where they live as a multi-generational family, with Evie's mother, Betty. This coming child is so very lucky to be born into this family!The choice of home birth is a natural one for Evie and Quinn. All of their children were birthed in birth centers, however they want to create a magical birth experience within their own sanctuary. Having a home birth will allow their three children to come and go as they please and be involved as much as they desire. Having them be in the comfort of their own home and be able to retreat to their own rooms will be a great benefit to them.While they know home birth is right for them, their insurance company doesn't cover the expenses of a midwife and other home birth expenses. The funds collected here will be used to pay the midwife directly for the services she renders throughout the pregnancy and birth. Her base fee is $4,500. The remaining amount will cover any recommended labs or supplements as well as supplies needed as listed on the home birth and water birth supply lists shown. Also, additional costs will accumulate since Evie was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism , which will result in more tests and extra supplements to support her and the baby's health. Quinn works very hard and brings home a solid income, however these additional costs would bring a great hardship on them. During this beautiful tranformation of their family, they should solely be able to on focus on loving their new, small human, rather than the stress of financial hardship. This is where you come in... Your support would greatly alliviate those financial pressures! The full payment of $4500 is due to the midwife by April 15. Additionally, they need to collect all supplies on the lists below to insure proper preparedness well in advance. You can help in a couple of ways:1. Contribute toward the fund, as you are able. Any increment is greatly appreciated!2. Please review the Supply Lists. If you have any of the items to give or loan (especially the birthing tub), please  consider donating them toward the birth. Here is a link to the SignUpGenius: http://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0e4ea5af2aa5fa7-evie Having the support of their friends and family is the greatest gift they could ever ask for. When you hear that ""it takes a village"", there is something very profound when the words become action. The power of having a support system, a community to reach out to gives strength and comfort to everyone involved. Asking for help is one of the hardest things for them and knowing that people are there and willing to help is a gift within itself. They are beyond grateful for all of your support whether it be financial or otherwise. To belong to such an incredible community of wonderful individuals is a dream come true for them.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-arthur,Support for Arthur,"Arthur is 24, was working at the Deli at Cub Crystal, and living at home with his twin brother, Tristan, and Mom and Dad, Lou Hoffman and Martin Quam. In early October he became ill with painful joints and a series of infections, which had us in and out of urgent care, the ER and the hospital. On Thursday, October27 he was admitted to North Memorial Hospital in Robbinsdae, MN. The doctors were scratching their heads and conferring with other Doctors acroos the country. By Sunday they had it down to auto-immune vasculitis, which is serious enough and rare enough to be concerned about. He has several skin lesions which are going to require skin graphs, eye damage that will require glasses and may require surgery in the future, kidney issues and more. If that isn't enough, the vasculitis caused a small stroke.  Luckily I was there when it happened and was able to call in the nurse. I can't tell you how horrible it was to listen to the doctor askinging him questions and Arthur's voice going softer and more slurred, and the only thing I could do was wait for Martin and Tristan and think, ""I'm listening to my son die.""After emergency surgery he spent 5 days in the ER for Brain Trauma. Not a fun place, everyone there had a sad, sad story. He was then transferred to the Brain Trauma care level, and then to Rehab on 11/15. He is now home and his recovery proceeds apace. But we are in need for some financial help. We have insurance provided by Martin's work, and Arthur has been placed on state insurance. But there is a LOT that isn't covered, or may be reimbursed, later. Co-pays, equipment (walker, shower seat, grab bars), taxis, (buses when the weather gets better), even new clothes! He dropped about 70 pounds and 3 sizes and all his old clothes simply fall off of him. So we are asking for help. We were barely squeaking by before this and now we are deep into a Minnesota winter with heating bills and all that, with no extras.

She continues to pay her cobra premium monthly and has a high deductible insurance plan.  She is unable to work and travel expenses are accruing as she continues her fight to find new cures.  Wendy is truly grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers from everyone! Please consider donating, all donations of any size are sincerely appreciated! Thank you! Please share :) 1/5/17 - Three days before her 53rd Birthday, on November 16, 2016, my dear friend Wendy Neudecker was diagnosed with Stage IV Esophageal Cancer.  She underwent many diagnostic tests/scans, and unfortunately, the cancer had metastasized to her liver and lymph nodes.  Esophageal Cancer is a rare cancer (about 17,000 cases per year in the US), it is typically relatively asymptomatic, and unfortunately often detected in late stages.  As we know, cancer does not pick and choose, her cancer was caused by a  common case of gastric reflux. Wendy is undergoing aggressive chemotherapy currently, and due to the spreading of the cancer, she will, unfortunately, have to undergo some type of chemotherapy for the rest of her life.  Wendy is an amazing, caring, and compassionate person. She has worked in healthcare as an office manager her entire adult life, and always greets everyone with a smile and a kind word. She is the proud mother of Michael Neudecker, a US Navy Navigator, and has two precious grandchildren, Max (3 1/2), and Mia (2). We are asking for help for Wendy to help her defray some of her medical expenses. She is single and does not have any other source of income. She has health insurance, but unfortunately has high deductibles, and large co-pays. Her chemotherapy copay alone exceeds $400.00 per month. In the upcoming months, Wendy's expenses will continue to climb. She will need further tests/scans, medications, specialist visits, and ancillary medically related needs.  Wendy is such a proud woman and has always been there to help others, but she needs our help now.  Wendy is truly grateful for the outpouring of love from everyone.  Please consider donating, all donations of any size are sincerely appreciated!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/stem-cells-for-steve,Stem Cells for Steve,"Cancer treatments are expensive, even with insurance and most of us do not consider all it entails. My co-worker, Steve has worked hard all of his life. He's energetic, funny, determined and most recently - an avid fighter. Steve was diagnosed with myeloma in October. Multiple myeloma, also known as plasma cell myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell normally responsible for producing antibodies. Initially, often no symptoms are noticed.  Luckily they caught Steve's cancer during routine lab work. At such an advanced stage he is extremely lucky not only that they caught it, but that he hasn't experienced the worst of what myeloma can do.  However, in an effort to treat this, his local cancer doctor collaborated with MD Anderson and decided to fight this as aggressively as possible. In November, Steve began his first round of chemotherapy. Even through his chemo treatments he still shows up at work everyday and gives it the same effort as before his diagnosis.In April, Steve will undergo a stem cell transplant. When it comes time for that, he and his family will be required to find housing close to MD Anderson before and after the transplant and that is where he will be - along with admittance to the hospital for 2-3 months. Housing, along with deductibles, prescriptions, hospital care and time off work for both himself and his wife will add up quickly. We would like to see Steve and Pam focus on getting through this and not have to be worry about being able to afford everything. I think we can all agree that stress and cancer need to be as far apart as possible from one another.   All of the money raised will be used solely for medical expenses and expenses related to this mandatory treatment.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/caliesmedicalfund,Calie's medical fund,"It saddens me as a mother/wife that things have gotten to this point, but as of now we have exhaustedall of our options and have been recommendedby a few freinds to try and start a go fund me page. I will try  my best to condence our whole story into a readable couple of paragraphs.      About 5 years ago our daughter Calie was born at 27 weeks extremely sick and premeture. We would soon find out that she was born with cCMV which is a nasty nasty virus that attacked her whole body including her brain. About a month into her 4 month NICU stay we started recieving the bad news that her brain wasnt growing. Upon further scans and tests it was discovered that she had severe brain damage and leukomalcaia. (deminished white matter of the brain). We were givin options as to if we wanted to proceed with life sustaining measures for her or let her pass. Before we had a chance to make that decision that no parent should ever have to make, she extubated herself (pulled her breathing tube out) and was able to sustain herself by nasal canula. At that point we had no chance but to fight for and with her. At that point, this hard hard journey of the last 5years of life began.         About a month into her NICU stay, I started my new job at Kaiser Permenente. A blessing that we had prayed for and that I had fought hard for for about 2 years. When Calie came home after her 4 month NICU stay, I got about a week off of work to be with her and then she began going to day care. After about a month home she ended up sick and back in the hospital. That began me having to take time off from work (the job I had just started about 2-3 months before). From that point on she was in and out of the hospital every couple weeks to months, causing her day care to no longer accept her due to how fragile and ill she was all of the time. I was forced to have neighbors watch her or whoever I could find, and that was short lived. After just shy of a year at Kaiser I was given the ultimatum to resign or be terminated, due to me having no more time to take off and my boss felt that she had done all she could at the time to help me and my situation out. I chose to resign with hopes of being hired back on later down the line. That was one of the hardest decisions I had ever had to make and I was completely heartbroken. It was at that time we started to have financial troubles as we were down to only one income. It would be about a year before we were able to start recieving IHSS and SSI for Calie, but even then it was no where near my income while working for kasier.        When Kaiser let me go, I then began my photography buisness, which I was ecstatic to be able to do. My buisness has truely been a blessing, but we still have not had the means to persue the buisness full time. Although it has been a huge blessing and has helped us get by at times it is a very unpredictable buisness and buisness is never guarenteed.         Calie's condtion has worsened emensly over the years, especially the past two. She has had more hospital stays then I can count, has spent every holiday for the past two years in the PICU, and we have come to know just about every single hospital personal at Kasier Permenente (which has been a blessing in disguise). Over the past 6-7 months Calie's condition has worsened severly and she is now fully vent dependant. When this process started about 7 months ago calie spent about 1-2 months in the PICU at kasier, and was then transfered to a rehab hospital for a little over 3 months. She then was transfered to Kaiser LA, and then back to kaiser fontana. All of that just to be able to bring her home on the vent.  She was finally able to come home, but that was short lived as after about 3 days home she was rehospitalized for pnuemnia and entrovirus. This one hit her hard and she just about didnt make it. That was one of the hardest phone calls to recieve as a parent. She did end up pulling through despite how poor her condition was, but has not been given too much longer to live. The next virus or cold she gets could be the one that takes her. Her body is fragile and tired and shes tired of fighting. Not only did that phone call scare us on the thought of losing her, but also in other aspects that will come along with that. Funeral expenses ect. To say the last half a year has been long, hard, and stressful would be a complete understatement. Not only has it taken a tole on us mentally, but financially as well. For those of you who recieve beneifts for children know that when they are hospitalized for more then 48 hours it has to be reported and the benifits then stop until the child is back home.  Aside from what I make doing photography we have been soley relying on my husbands income to get by. On top of all of that, we had to move into a big enough house to accomidate Calie and her nurses and all of her equipment. All of this hit us at the same time, and due to all of the above factors we are really struggling. It breaks my heart and my ego to even write this out and as for help, but at this point I feel like this is our last hope before things start getting really bad for us. Although now that Calie is home (she came home today) it will still be weeks before our beneifts kick back in. Even with that we are so behind on Calies medical bills, medications (which medical no longer covers :( ) and bills here at home. On top of all that we have the constant thought of how we will pay for her future funeral expenses and everyhting that comes along with that. I know that we have a lot of support and prayer warriors when it comes to Calie which is why we have made the tough decision to ask you all for help. Anything at this point will be great help and we appreciate anything that anyone is willing to donate. I have since started applying for jobs although I'm technically not supposed to work while receiving benefits for Calie we have been left no choice. We hope that I will get a bite soon and that this can all be behind us and we can finally be caught up and no longer financially burdened. We are truly heart broken that things have come to this point, but we truely and deeply appreciate all of the love and support from all of our friends and family members, as this is the toughest thing in life that we will ever go through and we couldn't make it through without all of the love and support. With all of our love, David, Ashley, Calie and our boys!",https://images.gofundme.com/rKcH_y8v5YMuSN-dnqRNYDSvc8c=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17199898_fb_1483570105.4428_funds.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Ashley Mora is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$4,025 raised of $5,000 goal"

She was just 5 years old at the time. As a child with complex congenital heart disease, also known as CHD, Noah has always been focused on helping others throughout all 4 of her open heart surgeries, several cath procedures, various hospital stays and just the daily challenges of being a 13 year old kid. To date, Noah Bella has raised over $100,000 through her Festival and numerous Lemonade stands, and is the Junior Ambassador for the Hopeful Hearts Foundation. Hopeful Hearts has used those funds to help heart families across the country by providing financial assistance and care packages.As many of you know, their journey led the Michaelis family to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in December, where Noah underwent a new cath procedure to treat a severe condition diagnosed just prior to this past Noah's Festival of Life in October.

Why? Because, as one city council member put it, Dallas needed to shut down Hinga’s garage in order to attract businesses like Starbucks and the Macaroni Grill.Using zoning laws to destroy small businesses is wrong. What they are doing is eminent domain in disguise, but without compensation. It is state-run gentrification.We’re raising money for a “Stop Zoning Abuse Defense Fund” for Hinga because no one should have to risk going bankrupt in order to stand up for what is right. At this point, the city’s lawsuit is pending in court. We expect a decision this summer. The city has asked the court to levy fines of $1,000 for each day Hinga spent waiting on the city to hear and decide his appeal of their zoning decision.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-smith-family,Support the Smith Family,"Dear friends,Over the last year, Josh has become a vital part of our family.  He is a boyfriend to my sister, a brother to my brothers, a son to my parents, and a friend to me and my husband.  Because of him, this past year has been filled with so much joy and laughter.Josh is known to everyone as the guy you can call on in a time of need. He will be there to help you or your family without hesitation no matter the situation. Through his time as a brother, boyfriend, friend, and father, he puts his family and friends first before thinking of himself. Unfortunately, the time has come for his friends and loved ones to return that dedication to help him through the biggest battle he will ever fight.On December 8th, 2016, Josh’s life was turned upside down. Our hearts have been shattered since.Josh had a seizure at work and was rushed to the hospital emergency room.  His coworker found him under a semi-truck convulsing and tried to subdue him so he was sitting up and alert while he called 911.  He later had a CT scan that showed a large mass on his brain, so the doctor wanted to do an MRI.  The results of the MRI showed there was a tumor on the left frontal part of Josh’s brain.  Dr. Holland, the neurosurgeon, then came in the room to tell discuss options.  He could get a sample of the tumor and test it to see if it was benign or cancerous, if cancerous he would later have to go in and remove it.  The other option was to be aggressive with the tumor and just remove it, since even benign tumors can become cancerous with time.   December 9th, at 8 am the nurses promptly came into Josh’s room to take him down to surgery.  My sister kissed him and told him that she would be right there waiting when he got back.  Back in the waiting area Dr. Holland came out and said the surgery went great and there were no complications.  When they brought Josh back, my sister saw him for the first time. He had 52 staples from ear to the other side of his forehead.  He was still not aware of his surroundings and it really took him a long time to come out of the anesthesia.   Once he did he passed all his neuro tests! Fast forward a few weeks - On December 21st, Josh’s staples were removed and they were being referred to an Oncologist for Radiation and Chemotherapy.   They were told Josh has a Grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma. What is this tumor?  This type of tumor is a fast-growing tumor.  The one removed on December 8th was the size of a golf ball.  So, the severity of it and why the prognosis isn’t good is if it grows back they can only remove so much, and certain parts of the brain are considered “inoperable”.   Josh needs to start radiation immediately. The radiation is to kill any potential cancerous cells that could turn into another tumor.   He will also do radiation to prevent those cells from growing as well. To make matters worse, Josh wasn’t aware he didn’t have health insurance when he was admitted to the emergency room. Luckily, my sister works in the health insurance industry so she was able to get Josh added onto her plan under the “domestic partners” clause.    While they are beyond thankful to have coverage, the coverage is proving to be a financial burden. Their plan has a $2,800 deductible and a $5,600 out of pocket maximum.   The prescription (Temozolomide) Josh needs to start radiation will cost them $3,663.88 up front.   And then they still have another $1,300 or to pay out for the next month’s prescription.  My sister is so thankful for all the support and help they have received from friends and family.  They have had numerous people bring easy meals, gift cards for groceries, help getting the boys to and from school, and so much more.  As you know, Josh is a father of two beautiful children who love him and my sister dearly. We are all praying for his recovery  The purpose of this fund in no particular order is:-  Take away as much stress as possible off of Josh -  Help offset the cost of missed work-  Medical bills and maintaining the day to day bills. We are asking for any donation that you can make to help Josh through this trying time. One dollar. Ten dollars. One hundred dollars. Any amount you can give us will greatly contribute to Josh’s recovery.  Whatever you can give will be welcomed and received with deep appreciation.Thank you all so much for your support, our family appreciates it from the bottom of our hearts!Josh is a compassionate human being and this is the least that I can do for him and his family!

En mai, 2 mois après la fin de ses traitements, Sarah  est retournée au travail de manière progressive.En septembre 2016 son oncologue nous a convoqué pour nous donner des nouvelles inquiétantes conçernant le dernier TEP scan de routine effectué. Conclusion, il soupçonne fortement un nouveau cancer, différent du premier. Ce serait cette fois un Lymphome Non-hodgkinien.Épuisée par les nombreux tests, chirurgies et démarches nécéssaires à la suite de la nouvelle annonce, Sarah est mise en arrêt de travail le 7 novembre 2016 .Depuis septembre, Sarah est toujours en attente d'un diagnostique final permettant de commencer les traitements, malgré la quasi-certitude du médecin.Le ""cocktail"" de chimiothérpie n'est pas encore déterminé, (dût au fait qu'elle a déjà reçu des traitements de chimiothérapie l'année dernière) mais la elle semble innévitable . Son docteur nous a aussi assuré que les traitements ne seraient pas aussi faciles que pour le premier cancer et qu'elle ne retournerait pas au travail pour un an après la fin des traitements.Après plusieurs mois d'attente, nos ressources personnelles commençent à s'épuiser.L'aide monaitaire permetterais à Sarah de vivre dans les meilleures conditions possibles tout au long de la prochaine année.Nous sous-estimons souvent le coût de la vie, mais un salaire de moins à la maison rappelle rapidement que les paiements de loyer, d'épicerie, d'assurances ou de voiture sont très présents et de plus en plus difficile assumer.Plus sur nous:Je m'appelle Charles A. Ethier 23 ans, je suis le conjoint de Sarah Balthazard  depuis près de 5 ans, et depuis novembre son fiancé !

She successfully went into remission in March 2016, and was able to return to work in May, two months after her treatments had ended. We were able to save enough to rent our first apartment together, and we were excited about our future together. In September 2016, after a routine PET scan, Sarah’s oncologist told us there were some abnormalities with her scan. Sarah was scheduled for an exploratory surgery. While Sarah was recovering from surgery, another PET scan was taken. Her doctors noticed a new, smaller lymph node beside the original affected organ that was very active (indicating it is also affected). Her oncologist strongly suspects a new cancer that is different and more aggressive than from before (a NON-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma). Exhausted by the numerous tests, surgeries, and procedures required to diagnose her new cancer Sarah had to leave work again in November. Despite Sarah’s oncologists near certainty, we have been waiting for yet another exploratory surgery which would give the final diagnosis needed to begin treatment. Without a definitive diagnosis Sarah cannot start the right chemotherapy. (almost a) Fun Fact: The aim of the different combination or “cocktail” of chemotherapy her oncologist will prescribe is going to try to kill as many cancer cells as possible without causing too much damage to healthy cells and lower the chances that cancer cells will develop mutations that will make them resistant to certain drugs.The oncologist can only tailor the cocktail when he knows the type of cancer, the stage it is at, and Sarah’s overall heath. Because Sarah has already received chemotherapy treatments last year her situation is more complicated. Her doctor has also assured us that the treatments would not be as easy as the first time she had cancer and she would not be able to return to work for a year after the end of her treatments. After several months of waiting for a diagnosis to start Sarah’s journey to recovery, our personal resources begin to run out. We don’t know what else to do. The monetary donations you would provide would help Sarah to live in the best possible conditions throughout the next year, and your moral and emotional support will help us get up in the morning and continue to move forward in our road to recovery.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kv-calebs-medical-fund,Caleb's Medical Fund,"Caleb has been battling Epilepsy for 16 years. He has been through 4 surgeries so far. Two were designed to reduce the amount of seizures he has and the last two were necessary due to complications from the second surgery. He will likely need at least one, but probably two more surgeries in the near future. He has been brave throughout his journey, always soldiering on and has graduated high school, has almost completed his Eagle Scout Rank for the BSA and plans to enter college in the Fall of 2017. He has two important decision-making appointments coming up in February in two states. Each of these physicians have a different idea of where to go from here, as none of the surgeries thus far have reduced the number of seizures he experiences. Although we do have insurance and have tried to take care of the remaining cost for his medical care, we still owe $11,000 since the last two surgeries. We also have had to travel four times a year to meet with his doctors as we had to move away from them for work and his treatment involves care that only they can provide. It would help us out greatly to raise funds for the upcoming February trip, the remaining medical balance and to have some put aside for future care expenses. We need the funds for the trip before mid-February and the existing bills are needing to be paid as soon as possible. Any way you can help would be greatly appreciated by our family. We need funds but are also asking for prayers for Caleb's future. Our hope is for him to be seizure free and able to enjoy a full and happy life.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/zachary-the-gastroschisis-warrior,Zachary the gastroschisis warrior,"Hi family and friends! I just want to start off by saying thank you so much for all the blessings, prayers, and positive thoughts. All of you have truly been a blessing to Michael, Zachary, and I. For you that don't know, let me tell you a little about our baby boy. Zachary was born with a condition called gastroschisis, where his intestines were on the outside when he was born. He was born via C-section on September 17, 2016, he was a month early. His birth wasn't the easiest, he came out not breathing and they had to preform CPR. After they got Zachary stable, he was cleaned up and his daddy was able to finish cutting the umbilical cord. He was then transferred to Children's in Oklahoma City. He had a silo put in, which would allow his intestines to slowly move back into his belly. Four days later, we laid our baby in surgeons arms and he was completely closer up. After a month of waiting for him to have his first poop and for his repogal to stop pulling bile. He finally pooped (and let me tell you I never imagined being so excited for poop lol) and his repogal cleared up. Then came our next struggle, feedings. For two months Zachary struggled with feedings, he would do really good then hit a wall and start throwing up bile. After two months of a lot of tears and frustration the surgeons sat us down and gave us two choices. Choice 1: put a feeding tube down and start continuous feeds (but he would need surgery eventually for a gtube) or choice 2: do an exploratory surgery, where they would pull out all his intestines run their fingers along the intestines and look for blockages. This choice was not easy for us to make, knowing both had risks. Michael and I finally made the choice to do the surgery. The next day we laid our baby in surgeons arms for the second time. The 1.5 hour surgery turned into a 5 hour surgery. They indeed found a blockage. They removed 8 cm of his bowel and his appendix. Then came our next speed bump, the ventilator. They tried removing the vent but due to so much swelling he was unable to really breath so they had to put the vent back in. They were able to remove it the next night. But due to all the putting in and taking out of the vent, it caused a large band of scar tissue in Zachary's airway. So a few days later we once again for the third time laid our baby boy in surgeons arms to have the scar tissue removed. Once all this was said and done Zachary was doing amazing and we were set to go home on Jan 2nd until he starting throwing up bile color again on Jan 1st. So now its a waiting game of trying to figure out what caused Zachary's back track. We really don't feel right asking for money, but things are starting to add up quickly.  So even if you can donate 1$, every little bit helps. And we have no clue how long we might be here. We are truly grateful for all you have done. Have an amazing day and God bless.",https://images.gofundme.com/xK_uNLf0KqKdzyite-28FKGngwA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17200290_1483571036.5032.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Samantha Ziegelmann is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,000 raised of $5,000 goal"

But the time has come that, In order to survive I need leave these lungs in my past and by the grace of God, receive new lungs. I have been blessed to live this long before needing a transplant and I never take a breath for granted. I have a laundry list of testing to go through, some will be easy and others will test my strength and will power. But Duke, is the best there is and they require (as all do transplant centers do) that we fundraise to help with costs. Trust me, I did not make this number up, it's what was recommended to raise. Because anything can happen. So, I need to do some extensive fundraising to help out with the things insurance won't cover. For expenses for before and after transplant, during the 6-8 months of living in Raleigh; it will help cover things like : food/groceries, travel for gas, utilities, oxygen and any uncovered medical trips for emergency reasons or medical procedures (not related to transplant) and of course the long list of new life long medicines.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/readerstoleaders,"""From Readers To Leaders""","“Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body” – Joseph Addison Thanks for stopping by our page! We are a team of educators from New York City who believe in the power and positive energy that reading can bring to students of all ages. Having West Indian roots, we have always had a special place in our hearts and a desire to give back to our people. We have chosen to focus on Haiti for this initiative. The people of Haiti, especially the children, have endured so much over the years. As educators, we know the positive impact that consistent exposure to reading can have on a child. Reading is a fundamental skill that all children should acquire in order to develop lifelong strategies necessary for success in life. Reading empowers the reader, builds on creativity and provides experiences for the mind that the body cannot physically live through. In order to  provide the children in Haiti with access to more books, we have assembled our team of educators to create a book fund to expand the library of Renaissance Academy, a school in Aux Cayes, Haiti. This area was severely affected by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.  Community Improvement and Development (CID) is a non-profit organization that is supporting our initiative. CID (cidhaiti.org) will cover portions of our transportation to, and lodging in Haiti to see this plan to completion. We urge you to please donate whatever you can towards the purchase of books written in both French and English.  The money raised will be used to purchase books and to cover the costs to send the books to Haiti. Our team will be on site in Haiti to distribute the books in February 2017.Help us expand the library in Renaissance Academy! Give their students the opportunity so many of us take for granted. By empowering the youth of Haiti, it will lead to a more stable, thriving, and self-sufficient community.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kathys-road-to-recovery,Kathy's road to recovery,"On Sunday  morning, January 1, 2017, our beloved Aunt Kathy mother to Lenny Llamas, suffered a massive ruptured brain aneurysm while driving and was rushed to San Antonio Community Hospital. It was quickly determined that she would need immediate treatment to clamp the aneurysm and was transferred to Pomona Valley Hospital. Unfortunately, the initial procedure was unsuccessful and the doctor recommended another transfer to UCLA Medical Center for brain surgery. The amazing staff successfully executed a 12 hour surgery to repair the aneurysm, but advised us she would be in critical condition for the next 2 weeks. Although still sedated, Kathy was responding physically to the doctor's tests and we remained hopeful for recovery. To our extreme disappointment, on 1-6-17, Aunt Kathy's brain began to swell and she needed immediate surgery to remove a portion of her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain. We have been informed that she will remain under constant care here at UCLA for up to 3 months while she heals and goes through the initial steps of rehabilitation. She will undergo countless scans and tests, and at least one additional surgery to replace the portion of her skull that was removed. Aunt Kathy did not have medical insurance, and although she was approved for MediCal, it will only begin to assist in the overwhelming expenses accrued during her stay. We have a long financial journey to repay these debts, but that is nothing compared to the long road to recovery that our aunt will endure. We are incredibly grateful to have her with us and fighting so hard to stay with her family.  Aunt Kathy always used to say ""if you don't A-S-K you don't G-E-T"". We are appreciative of anything you may be able to donate to our Aunt Kathy's medical costs. -Leticia and Monique",https://images.gofundme.com/Bjol5Bu6FIH0lsBIZEIb4honNtg=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17200618_1483930840.4651.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Leticia Martinez is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,975 raised of $10,000 goal"

I have spent the past few years traveling, doing shows and speaking to youth across the U.S. (check out my website for more details on who I am and what I do www.alonspeaks.com). My message is simple: Life is messy, and Jesus wants to help us make sense of this messy thing called life. I know this first hand as I was born into a broken home, put into foster care at the age of 7, and grew up in foster care, group homes and other institutions. But as a teen, I encountered Jesus in the middle of my mess, and he changed my life...and continues to do so. I want to share my story with as many people as I can, and I want to help people share what Jesus has done in their lives as well. In Mark 16 Jesus tells those following him ""Go everywhere and announce the message of God's good news to one and all"". I want to do that and motivate others to do the same this year. I want to see the good news of Jesus spread! Here is an opportunity for you to partner with me. I want to raise $23,000...that's right...$23,000...I know, it sounds like a lot, but if everyone pitches in, we can raise this together easily! No Sweat! And I believe we can raise it by August 1, 2017. What am I raising this amount for?- The writing, editing, publishing and distribution of my book ($8765.00)- The producing, recording, editing, mixing, mastering, and cd production of the album ($12,250.00)There is an 8% payment to Gofundme so that would take it right around 23k. One rain drop doesn't seem to effect much...but get all it's fellow rain drops together and you can fill a lake and more! Will you join me by donating? For those who do, I would like to give you a gift:- If you donate a minimum of $20.00 you will receive an electronic copy of the album when it is finished. - If you donate a minimum of $40.00 you will receive a copy of the album + a MSP T-shirt when they are finished. - if you donate a minimum of $60.00 you will receive copy of the album + MSP T-shirt + an electronic copy of the book when they are finished. Thank you for reading this. And no matter what you give, I want to give a big thank you to YOU for taking this opportunity to be a part of what God has me doing this year...together...with you!- Alen Auguste",https://images.gofundme.com/OrHiJ4oivAR18hCJAp9ZQgGt64Y=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17200646_1483588318.1733.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Alen Auguste is organizing this fundraiser.,"Missions, Faith & Church","$5,100 raised of $23,000 goal"

From about 1979 to 1982, he was a youth counselor and substance abuse counselor in Riverside County.In 2007, he joined the Head Start policy Council for the County of San Bernardino Preschool Services Department. While involved there, he discovered a passion for early childhood education and parent involvement, especially male involvement in the lives of young children.Ed became a tireless advocate for these causes and never stopped. He  subsequently served as the Head Start policy Council Chairperson until 2010. After that he served as an advisory board member to First 5 San Bernardino, a Board Member for Easter Seals of Southern California and on the Snowline Unified School District Community Cabinet. Ed was so passionate about giving underprivileged children the chance to succeed that he attended nearly every school board meeting and helped form a committee that donated books to disadvantaged children, even driving the books to donation sites in his own car. Partially as a result of these efforts, this year the county will offer a literacy program called Footstep to Brilliance to all the children in our county.At the time of his death, he was working on a fatherhood program and ways to reduce the number of homeless women and children in our county.Ed's sudden loss has left his family and children with the burden of managing living expenses, funeral and medical expenses.

Since my brush with death and amputation, I've been denied disability and forced to work as a server on my feet for six or seven hours a day at a time. I was receiving Medi-cal insurance benefits to help cover my prosthetic costs. Since I've been forced to work because I've been denied disability, I've recently been denied insurance coverage.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/preschoolers-dream-loft,Preschoolers' Dream Loft,"Dear community,We are a couple of preschool teachers from SouthWest Early Learning Bilingual Preschool, looking to fundraise money for materials and labor for our project “A House for Little People.” This project will help us build a loft in the Salmon Creek classroom and continue the children’s interest in engineering and architecture. Some of the funds will be used for equipping the children with some basic tools, materials and labor to continue this project.Why are we doing this? As a non-profit, free bilingual preschool located in the heart of West Seattle- Delridge, we hold some fundraising events during the school year to allocate money for field trips, supplies, and the overall quality of care for our children and classroom. However, by doing this for the Salmon Creek community, not only do we provide the children with the experience to have a loft in their classroom, but also a learning opportunity that would reflect this process. Based on our values and philosophy that we hold here at SWEL, we strongly believe that a play-based curriculum will meet the developmental needs of the children in our care, and prepare them for their future. During their play and our observations, we first began to notice their interest in construction and building. This led us to take on projects around height and measuring, as well as, learning about the creation of blueprints (plans). A child, who participated in our summer learning program, referenced a project we did with the Columbia Tower; with this new idea in mind, we based the study around architectural engineering. We have taken our children on several field trips including, The Home Depot, the Columbia Tower and observing buildings around the Delridge community. Here, we began the dialogue around the importance of the tools they need to create “stuff”. We had a discussion around what project we can work on as a class using tools, and “a house for little people” was an enthusiastic suggestion from one of our students. A loft will provide endless possibilities - anywhere from congregating, reflection, and experiencing new height levels that aren’t already accessible in our classroom; along with opportunities to presumably solve many social emotional differences the children may have with one another.   As the children’s teachers, we know that this is a process and we are trying to evoke these very same principles to the children.  We believe that this fundraiser will benefit them greatly in all aspects of their learning. They’ll learn more about the benefits that come from organized planning, research and being enrolled at a non-profit bilingual preschool. We just hope you share this same vision with us and help us meet or exceed our goal. Thank you for taking the time to read and being part of our legacy.

We were finally going to be able to start actually paying down our maxed out credit cards a little bit. But then the accident happened. It shouldn't have been a big deal. I just ran into a spare tire into the middle of the road. My insurance got it taken care of and all should have been well. My car was given back to me in seemingly fine shape. Only a few days later though, it broke down. Since then it's been a nonstop nightmare. For a month now I've been going back and forth arguing with the service shop that worked on it and my auto insurance, and no one will take responsibility for it. I've had to keep going back and forth with rental cars and Uber rides just to get my wife and I back and forth to our jobs. I've lost over $500 just on rental cars and Uber rides now, and the total cost to get my car repaired is $2,500.I've got $0 left in my checking account at this point. I spent the last of my money on the rental car I'm currently driving. In one week that rental will be up though, so if I don't have my own car back or at least enough money for another weeks worth of rental, both my wife and I will no longer have any ability to get to and from our jobs. This puts us on the verge of losing our jobs, and in turn losing our house that we worked so hard for and becoming homeless.We need $3,200 to get the car repaired and get out of the hole caused by the rental cars. I can't make any promises, but anyone who donates I will try my damndest to pay back when/if ever possible. Tax returns are coming up, so it is highly likely I will be able to repay at least a decent percentage of money donated.

Susan has an autoimmune disease that has put her through the ringer for years. Without health insurance, all her (precious little) money goes to bus fare back and forth to her doctor's visits, copays, prescriptions and all the things her weak body needs to survive. Susan is also a giver. She is generous to a fault. She will give until she has nothing left to give. Her time, her help, her services, her health. She has given so much to this community and to ME personally.     Susan is struggling. Since most of her funds have gone to her health, she has been fallen behind in rent. Between the late fees that are accrewing daily and the months that have passed she is over her head. She finally has health insurance to bear the more serious burden of medical costs, but she is far enough behind on her regular bills that her landlord has given her 5 days before eviction. She needs $5000 immediately for them to even stop the process. She turned to me for help.     Being a single mom myself, there is only so much I can do to help financially (I would give this woman the moon were I able), but I have faith in my city. I have faith in my community. I have faith in my neighbors.     Please, if you felt compelled to donate to my campaign. Donate to Susan instead. If you were thinking of going to see a movie tonight...Donate to Susan instead. If every one of you gave five dollars, a hard working single mother could stay in her home. I have faith in this city. Please help me show Susan how loved and important she is in this community. Help me show Susan that when you ask for help, the people who love you will show up in droves.      There is a reason that Susan is not running a gofundme herself. She is terrified (She took it as a sign to use her first name when the generic option was ""Susie's medical fund""). She is proud. She is worried that if people knew it was her that they wouldn't donate at all. I'm CERTAIN that's not the case. But I do know this we all have an extra five dollars.Please Save our Susan.

Karen is doing her best to support Glenn with minimal outside help. We would like to raise some much needed money for alternative treatments or at the very least for a holiday for Glenn and Karen.*There is a lot more information and details relating to Glenns illness and treatments thusfar that I don't know the exact details of, but due to the urgency of needing this fundraiser up and running, I have included what I do know. I am trying to keep this a secret from Glenn, so getting more details is difficult at the moment.Glenn began having some trouble swallowing certain foods, he was a little concerned so went to get it checked it out at the Doctor. The doctor prescribed some medication and sent Glenn on his way, however the medicine didn't help so Glenn went back to the doctor and after being sent for a gastroscopy was diagnosed as having stage 4 Oesophageal cancer on 7th October 2015.In October 2015, Glenn and Karen went to stay in Sydney so that Glenn could have treatment for his Oesophageal cancer. The 'more effective' chemotherapy didn't seem to help the cancer but the radiation seemed to shrink some of the oesophageal tumours, however new tumours began to appear in the lymph glands, liver and the lung developed spots too. In August 2016, Glenn was accepted for an immunotherapy trial hoping this would be the miracle that would cure this horrible disease. Sadly Glenn was removed from the trial after 3 or 4 treatments as it wasn't working. At the end of October the tumours in the liver had tripled in size with the other tumour markers more than doubling in less than a month. By early December Glenn had developed blood clots in both lungs and had to begin injecting himself with blood thinners twice a day.9th December 2016 Chemotherapy was stopped, there is nothing that the doctors can do to help Glenn anymore.Karen and Glenn refuse to give up hope and they would like to look at alternative therapies as well as other drugs that they can't receive funding for.Needless to say Karen and Glenn can't afford this on their own and they desperately need our help to raise money.In the last 2 weeks, Glenn has lost 7kgs, he is rapidly declining and is finding it harder and harder to move around and even breathing is getting harder for him.Time is of the essence, as we don’t know how much longer Glenn has left without the help of any treatment.* Dr's and Nursing staff have now advised that Glenn should begin Palliative care.",https://images.gofundme.com/sXJE_nJ4nmBxDE1V4RCTfUY8-2Y=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17202676_1483667032.8406.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Lori N Brendan Hancock is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,250 raised of $10,000 goal"

She immediately went in for a lumpectomy in November 2015, started numerous chemo treatments and radiation. This treatment was just not enough to fight this awful cancer. Angela went though genetic testing and all came back negative.( Her paternal grandmother had breast cancer) Through all the  appointments she has kept a positive and  fighting outlook, always with a smile on her face , even through the pain. Thankfully, she has worked for Kaiser for many years and had a great benefit plan to help with the expense of all the surgeries, treatment and medication.  Unfortunately this fight is not over - Angela is courageous!

When this journey started we were  so hopeful that she would be in full remission within 6 months, not the case. She has been fighting this battle going on 15 months. With all the surgeries, chemo, radiation and medication thankfully covered by her insurance.Angela and Kevin have been able to skimp by with disability insurance and social security for family needs.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-bear-walk-again,Help Bear Walk Again,"On December 17th, just two short days after celebrating his 7th birthday, my dog Bear was doing what he loves the most - running through the woods and playing with his doggie friend Milo. Only this time was different. Instead of gracefully maneuvering through the trees like usual, Bear went crashing into one. I knew something was wrong when he didn't immediately get up and continued to lay on the ground. After a week of continuously not putting any weight on his left leg, my dad took him to the vet. We received the unfortunate news that Bear had torn his left ACL. We were to wait for a couple weeks to see how this would heal and give him two types of pain medications daily. If the leg didn't heal properly, Bear would have to have surgery.I was hopeful that Bear would heal on his own and not have to go through the stress of surgery. However, my hopes were dashed after I called Bear to come to me one morning after he'd been outside. I will never forget what happened - one moment Bear was limping his way to come inside and the next he was crumbling to the floor while letting out the most heartbreak cry of pain. After spending four hours in the emergency vet clinic, I was told that Bear's ACL on his right leg had torn as well. If you knew Bear before all of this happened you might have believed he had been a thoroughbred in a past life. He could run for hours and would go as fast as his legs would take him. Now he relies on being carried from room to room or outside for a couple minutes throughout the day.So now with two torn ACLs, Bear is in need of a bilateral cruciate ligament repair. Having been in contact with three surgical veterinarians to figure out Bear's best option, I have found that the price of surgery to repair this will be the outstanding total of $6,000. Half of the amount is needed as a down payment the day of the surgery while the rest must be paid the day he is released. Everyone believes their dog is the best dog in the world and they absolutely are, each and every one. How wonderful are these selfless creatures that make us laugh and feel loved and put a smile on our faces daily? I was the luckiest girl in the world adopting Bear from the local pound 7 years ago as a birthday present to myself. He has been with me through high school, college and now a post-grad ""grown up"" life. He has been with me through sickness and heartbreak, celebrations and memories I will never forget. He is my personal four-legged shadow that follows me everywhere. I am asking for your help to heal my Mister Bear, to give him a chance to live a full life with me in comfort. I have no expectations on how much I will actually be able to raise but even the smallest amounts help.

Their first concern was their dog. They found Oden laying on the floor but thankfully he was okay and they were able to get him out.Tony ran inside to see what he could do. He could tell it was electrical, flames in between the walls and floors. He tried to put it out himself with buckets of water while they waited for the local fire department to arrive. In their small town there are no fire hydrants, so water trucks came from three districts. As the tanks emptied, the trucks had to leave to refill and the flames took off and completely engulfed the house. Once the smoke cleared all that was left was a chimney and basement. They left with the clothes on their back, their wallets and car keys. As two young kids in love, just starting out in life, money is very tight. For the last three years, every Christmas, birthday & graduation, Victoria collected household items, dreaming of her future.  It is heartbreaking to watch your child experience a loss of hope. I've started this page in hopes of helping them get started on rebuilding their lives.  I know it's a tough time of year for everyone's budgets being right after Christmas and so we thank you all in advance for anything you give.  Already the outpouring of support has been so amazing and they are starting to have hope again.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/nick-fords-heart-surgery-fund,Nick Ford's Heart Surgery Fund!,"Once you have met Nick Ford, you know how truly special he is. You may have met Nick in Missoula, maybe it was up at Snowbowl, on the river or out on the trails. Nick’s love of the outdoors is contagious. You may have found yourself lost in conversation with Nick while talking about the latest snow report, where the elk are hiding this year, or sharing some fly fishing tips. He loves the outdoors, but what he enjoys the most is sharing these experiences with family and friends, both new and old. When Nick isn’t meeting up with friends or family, he is pursuing his dream of owning and operating his own fishing and hunting guide service. On the off season, he is getting people properly equipped to get up on the mountain and enjoy the amazing terrain and views that Snowbowl has to offer. It’s not hard to see Nick’s drive and passion for life. Due to a recent diagnosis Nick hasn’t been able to live his life to the fullest.  Nick’s heart has been causing him to slow down, restricting him from his passions in life. Nick was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse with a severe valve regurgitation on the left side of his heart and will need open heart surgery in early 2017. Due to Nick having Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disorder that destroys connective tissue in the body, this will be Nick’s second heart surgery in the last decade and he just turned 28. Mitral valve regurgitation is when the blood is leaking backward into the heart. Heart valves work like one-way gates, helping blood flow in one direction between heart chambers or in and out of the heart. To get Nick’s blood flowing in the right direction, he will need surgery to repair his heart. Due to other health factors from the previous surgery, the surgery Nick requires is very specialized, and there are only a few surgeons in the country that can do the procedure. Luckily, we have found a surgeon in California willing to take on such a procedure using a technique that will minimize Nick’s recovery time. The goal in setting up this account is to relieve some of the financial burden and emotional stress on Nick. We have planned a budget that includes most of the expenses that will come up along the way. First, the preliminary expenses, which will include Nick’s health insurance maximum, allowing him to get the necessary tests needed before the procedure and covering the entire cost of the procedure ($6,000). The budget also includes travel expenses to San Diego for the surgery and a week’s stay ($5,000). Then we have planned for Nick’s recovery period, which will cover Nick’s bills for two and half months while he is unable to work ($5,000) and 24/7 care for a month ($2,000). This is a conservative estimate of the initial costs for the out-of-pocket expenses, but there may be unexpected expenses that could arise at anytime. We appreciate any and all support! We will also keep everyone updated throughout the recovery process through a blog that will be set up for Nick. Please consider helping Nick get back to doing what he loves, with the people who love him!",https://images.gofundme.com/O08RcHJsFd8Mt6fSf_tQcHgvgpk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17203804_1483579660.4047.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Madeleine Renee Equaysayway Hull is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Nicholas Ford.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$16,279 raised of $22,000 goal"

What is bilateral medial patellar luxation? In non-medical terms, it's when the kneecap (patella) is dislocated from its normal anatomic position in the groove of the thigh bone. Sometimes it shifts slightly, and in other cases- moves entirely around. This x-ray, sourced from Animal Medical Center of Southern California, shows a canine patient before and after surgery. As you can imagine, having your kneecaps out of place would be pretty painful and difficult to live with. This is what our Frenchie is going through right now. It's gotten so bad that he can no longer walk at all, and urinates and defecates himself because he's unable to make it to the litter box. What we're looking for is your help to pay for his medical costs. All money raised from this fundraiser goes directly to the veternary clinic to help pay his fees. This surgery & before/after care is going to cost around $3,500, and the need is immediate. We don't want Frenchie to suffer any longer! Who are we?

https://www.gofundme.com/f/everlys-hospital-bills,Everly's Hospital Bills,"So I am doing this out of desperation. In December both twins were diagnosed with RSV and Pneumonia. Emme spent 5 days in the hospital and came home. The night before Emme as released Everly was diagnosed. Things have gone down hill from there rapidly. Within 12 hours of getting RSV, Everly went from being on small assistance to being placed in PICU on full sedation and intabation. PICU stands for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. She has been there since December 19, 2016. Her lungs have collapsed as her RSV grew to Strep Pneumonia. She is on 5 different narcotics to keep her sedated so she does not pull out her breathing or feeding tubes. John and I have been splitting the time living in the hospital or being home with the kids. On Monday January 2, 2017 we saw a glimmer of hope as her lungs were clear and fully inflated. They removed her breathing tube and started to wean her off the medication. That hope did not last long. While the RSV and everything is gone, she is not handling the withdrawal symptons very well. She is fighting the medication to the point that when she does fall into a natural sleep she suffers from apnea. In a 2 hour window her alarm went off so many times that they had to intabate her and sedate her again. We are looking at a long haul in the hospital and after care treatment. They are talking at least another month possible for her to be on Fentanyl, Methadone and additional medications. Even when she comes home she will still be on Methadone and another slowly withdrawing till she is completly clean.  While John is out on FMLA he is not getting paid. Con Ed also after 2 weeks no longer pays for the medical insurance so now on top of our deductible we have to pay for the insurance or Cobra out of pocket. All money raised will ease some of the stress as it will help keep one of us home caring for Emme and her appointments while the other can stay at the hospital and care for Everly. We are running out of savings very quickly. Thank you to everyone who donates as well as shares this without judgment.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/sams-medical-bills-for-addie,Sam's Medical Bills for Addie,"Hi everyone.My name is Becca Dirmeikis and one of my best friends, Sam Saban needs any help she can get during this difficult time for her. I have known Sam for just over 6 years and she has quickly became a very important person in my life, simply because of the fact that she is so kind and caring.First off, let me tell you a little bit about Sam. Sam is a 23-year old Specical Education teacher in Urbana. She is young and does not have a selfish bone in her body. She has the biggest heart for people, but especially for animals. She has so much patience for everyone in her life, including her students, and is willing to go to the ends of the Earth to make sure everyone is well taken care of. She has always paid every bill on her own, without the help of anyone.This summer, Sam found the love of her life, Addie. She adopted Addie from an animal shelter. Addie is a german shepard, husky mix and they quickly became best friends and were inseperable. I mean, INSEPERABLE. Addie goes anywhere Sam goes. When the weather was nice, Sam, Addie and I used to go to Memorial Stadium and all run stairs together. Everytime Sam and I would leave her apartment, she turns to Addie and gives her 15 treats and a bone so shes not so sad and always says, ""Mommy loves you Addie. I will be home soon."" Then proceed to tell me that she feels so bad for leaving her, even if we were going to be gone for 20 minutes. Addie has become Sam's shadow and they have a bond that is something that I have never seen before. Addie is the most loving and affectionate dog.  She makes her dinner every night. I don't mean she takes her dog food and puts it in a bowl. I mean, she makes her salmon and won't eat her own food until her and Addie can sit next to each other and eat together. She's not Sam's dog, she is her baby.On the morning of New Years Eve, I got a phone call from Sam and as soon as I answered, I knew I had never heard Sam cry the way she was in that moment. She hysterically told me that Addie got hit by a car while she, her mom and sister were walking her. The metal clasp on Addie's leash broke off when Addie pulled and Addie went running into the street and a car hit her. The car did not even stop. Sam told me she thought Addie was going to die because she was not moving. When talking to Sam's mom, she told me that Sam fell to her knees in that moment and everyone knew Sam's world would  never be the same. By the strength of God and love, Addie somehow pulled through and she is still with us today. However, Addie now has two dislocated hips, a fractured vertebrae and slipped disc in her neck. She has road rash and a huge cut underneath her hip that has required her to get lazor treatments by the Vet to help the wounds heal. She has also had a CT to try and rule out any other internal injuries she may have or could develop. Not to mention, all the medication that Addie is on.  Sam had to opt out of an MRI that would have deteremined the full scope of her injuries because she could not afford it.  As you can imagine, Sam is up to her eyes in medical bills and the whole process has just started. Addie will not be able to walk for 3 months. Sam needs to keep on her bed rest and limit her movements. I have been with Sam at her apartment since she has come back to Champaign with Addie and it's been extremely difficult to see Sam and Addie like this. All in all, I thought at the very least, I could try and help Sam with some medical bills. The littliest amount would mean the world to Sam. She already just making ends meet and this has turned her world upside down but yet she is doing it with a smile and just is as loving and caring as she ever was. She truly is an angel. A sleepless, tired angel, may I add because she doesn't sleep. She stays up with Addie all night on the floor and still goes to work the next day because her kids need her too. Sam is the type of person that would never accept money from someone but she truly cannot do this on her own. She is trying to pay off bills when she can and if you know Sam, Addie, the Saban Family or just have a love for animals, any bit of support would be everything to her. Thank you for your support.",https://images.gofundme.com/5GzhNktyr1KoMht_Vp-I-AyRno8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17203940_1483891724.2568.jpg,[],0,"Created January 8, 2017",Becca Lynn is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Sam Saban.,Animals & Pets,"$4,730 raised of $5,000 goal"

Unfortunately instead the knock on the door that day that my aunt and uncle received was the sheriff delivering every parents worse nightmare. Heather had been involved in a head on collision and didn't survive the accident. As you can imagine this news came as a disbelief and an enormous amount of pain as Heather had just turned 30 years old 2 days prior to the accident and was leaving behind a 6 yr old son, named Lane. Not only has this left a hole in the family's heart, but it has also left them an immense responsibility of telling her son he will never see his mommy again. Those who knew Heather knew she was full of life and had a heart as big as Texas and never ever took NO for an answer!! She was funny with a little bit country, a girly girl and rebel all rolled into one. She has always been a daddy's girl and liked to be hands on even if it meant getting dirty. She liked to work on her truck, hunt and fish! She loved gardening and even had one of her own and loved junkyard art ! She was also quite crafty and made her own plaque and named herself ""The Perfect Storm"". If you ever rode with her, you know that you had to listen to her music and rarely did she finish a full song. She exuded confidence and beauty and will be deeply missed by all who knew her. Her son Lane loves playing with toy guns, riding bikes arcades and fishing with his dad. He is a very loving, caring and sensitive young boy who is really going to miss going to carnivals and water parks with his mommy .

To all of us, Lloyd was more then just a neighbor, he was a father figure to all the kids growing up in the neighborhood. If you needed someone to talk to regarding your problems, he was the man. If you needed advice on anything, he would always have an open ear. But the main thing was if you ever wanted a good laugh or simply just needed to put a smile on your face, you went to Llyod. He was one of the funniest human beings that I have ever met and if you knew him you would say the exact same. Going to see Llyod and Joanne at the end of the day was on all of our schedules every single day growing up as a kid, because that’s where we went to get rid of all our problems and just laugh the night away with jokes. Lloyd walked into Joanne, Gio and Brianna’s life with the most loving and open arms. He raised those two kids as if they were his own. He was by Joannes side each and every day and offered as much love as he could to all three of them. The family does not have the financial means to give Lloyd the burial that he deserves. So we come to all of you to please open your hearts as well as your wallet and help with the cost of his funeral arrangements. Any donation, big or small, would be greatly appreciated.

This devastating news has meant an early and unexpected retirement, plus a whole lot of uncertainty about the future.            Over his 19 years with NESN John often traveled with the Red Sox and Bruins. He was there in 2004 when the Sox finally broke that famous curse and he was in Vancouver when the Bruins won Game 7 to take home the Stanley Cup in 2011. If you ever watched a Bruins or Red Sox game, then you saw his work.  He also shot dozens of episodes of Charlie Moore Outdoors and a series of top notch documentaries covering some of New England's greatest athletes and stories. And he was pretty good at what he did, winning 5 Emmy Awards for his work.          Through all the grueling travel and long nights,  Johnny always had a smile on his face, the amazing ability to talk to- literally- everyone he came into contact with, and a wry sense of humor. Needless to say he made a lot of friends. He met and married the love of his life, Adrienne, and they have 2 beautiful daughters.            ALS is a terrible progressive neurodegenrative disease that ultimately robs the body of its ability to move, however, John's diagnosis has not dimmed his natural exuberance or zest for life. He is an inspiration to all of us. But with the future cloudy we, his friends, want to make sure that John and his family don't need to be concerned about money, now or in the future.             We humbly ask that you make any donation you can to help out. Think of his wife and 2 young daughters, think of one of your best friends fighting a cruel, debiltating disease, think of the great New England sports moments John helped bring into your home, or just do something nice for a truly good person.           Thanks,           The Friends of John P.

In 2017, we'd like to raise even more! More the merrier in regards to attendance. However, if you are unable to be there, you can still donate to the cause! We're asking for a minimum $15/person donation. Cash will also be accepted at the event.  To give everyone an idea of where their donated money is going towards, check out the list of acts below followed by the charity they are performing for: 1. Jackie Kauffmann – Stray Rescue 2. Jack Berg – Backstoppers 3. Mike Brazzle – Trisomy Research  4. Gary Sluhan – Backstoppers 5. James Schmittgens – Stray Rescue 6. Katherine Mary Sluhan – Shriners Hospital 7.

What type of acts are performed?  There are no restrictions on acts - though we ask performers to refrain from too offensive language and content. We are trying to be relatively kid friendly. Last year we had dancers, singers, guitarist, trumpeters, a stand-up comedian, a variety act, and more!  3. Will there be food and beverage?  There will be kegs of refreshing beer, though feel free to BYOB. Unfortunately there will be no food (i.e. more money for charity!). Please eat beforehand to avoid drinking on an empty stomach : )  4. What is the format of the talent show?  There will be 1 round where every act gets a chance to showcase their talents.  After all acts have gone, the crowd determines winner via a facebook link or good old hand written ballet.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/roger-mcgraths-cancer-fund,Roger McGrath's Cancer Fund,"My Dad, Roger McGrath, was diagnosed with Stage IV Large Diffuse B-Cell and Follicular Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) in May 2016, just a week before Father's day. Since his diagnosis, he has undergone aggressive chemotherapy treatments at the Cancer Center in Green Bay. As you can see from the picture, my Dad has a way of bringing people together and making them smile :) He's never once asked for help through this entire process, he never wants to inconvenience anyone or be a burden. But of course myself, my brothers, my Mom, our spouses and our extended family and friends have all been there to support him making visits to the cancer center and calling and sending their love. We cannot thank you enough for all your kind words and help along the way.  At this point we are asking for more help. Dad is now receiving his second round of chemo, as tumors still remain. Because of the aggressive nature of the cancer and course of action, he is being hospitalized and given chemo for 72 hours straight and will repeat this process a total of three times. If all goes well, the next step will be for him to receive a stem cell transplant within the month or so.  Unfortunately because of the year my Dad had in 2016, starting off with needing double knee replacement surgery (but only getting one done so far) then just a few months later finding out he has NHL, he had to take a lot of time off work. Because of this time he did not fulfill his required hours to stay employed and as of Jan 2017 he will be unemployed.  My parents are left in a very stressful and potentially very expensive position until they find out what's next. They will need to purchase insurance that can preferably guarantee his cancer treatments can continue at the same clinics with his current doctors. With my Dad being unemployed for an undetermined amount of time my parents will have a lot of medical and household bills to worry about in addition to my Dad's health and recovery.  My Dad was always involved with our sports and activities when were kids, never missed a game even though he worked 45 minutes away from home. He continues to teach my brothers and I important life lessons and he is the kind of guy you really listen to, take advice from and believe in. For as long as I can remember he's volunteered for the Knights of Columbus in DePere, will help a friend out at the drop of hat and ALWAYS put others before himself. He is a Vietnam Era Veteran. He is the kind of Dad, father-in-law, husband, Grandfather and friend you constantly feel lucky to have. He is always putting a smile on your face and loves his family deeply.For everything he and my Mom have done for me and my brothers, the least we can do is try to help with their financial burden at this time. We can't thank everyone enough for everything they've done to help us out during this time and any amount of financial assistance we can get would be just wonderful for my parents.  Any amount helps. Thank you so much for taking the time to read his story and considering helping our family.  -The McGraths",https://images.gofundme.com/1RuIiqQ2fxwdMX1jqy-joDdWrmc=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17204858_1483582263.1264.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Helen Bradley is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$9,025 raised of $5,000 goal"

Needless to say, we have moved to a different agency that is THRIVING and facilitates adoptions in all 50 states.  They are quite a bit more expensive though and their ""matching fee"" is $7,400.  This will put us into their networking program where we will be matched with a birth mom.  Once we are matched, there is another whole list of fees that we will need to tackle, but one step at at time.  We already have $3,700 of this fee saved and are looking to raise the other half of it (our homestudy is able to carry over at no cost to us).  We are asking that you consider donating ANY amount to allow us to parent a child in need.  If you are not able to donate money, your prayers are also valued so much.  We have been waiting for over 10 years to have a child and we hope that this new agency will help us get closer to seeing that dream come true.God bless you all!Joel and Sarah",https://images.gofundme.com/_2OoCmugjL6akSaE6ojv3iHjdyE=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17205022_fb_1483582243.7749_funds.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Sarah Cope is organizing this fundraiser.,"Babies, Kids & Family","$2,375 raised of $3,700 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/lauras-medical-treatment,Laura's medical treatment,"Like many people, Laura and Dan were just one medical emergency away from financial ruin.  In late December, that became their reality.  Just before Christmas, Laura experienced a severe bout of confusion that led to an ER visit.  After an MRI, it was discovered that she had a stage 4 glioma cancerous brain tumor.  6 days into what would become a 12 day hospital visit, a mass the size of a large strawberry was removed from her brain.  Dan is a retired auto and fork lift mechanic and he's struggling to find work at 70.  Laura, 54, was the primary bread winner, but with the tumor having damaged her speech, her career in medical office management is over.  Her memory and some motor control have also been impacted.  At this time, medical disability is their only option.  Given the case load in the state of Colorado, it takes an average of 15 months from the time a claim is filed until the first disability check arrives.  Even before the coming expense of medical treatment, without financial help, they are at risk of eviction every month until social security disability kicks in.In late November, they filed for bankruptcy to help mitigate mounting debt.  With a serious illness now thrown in, they don't know what else to do.  Below is the letter she wrote asking for help. ""My name is Laura and this past December I was admitted to the hospital under an emergency. After a day in the hospital and they had performed an MRI my family and I were informed that I have a Stage 4 Cancerous Brain Tumor. I didn't have any idea that I had this growing in my brain, I knew that I did not feel good for some time but just thought that it was related to everyday stress, so I just kept going.I was an office manager for a wellness center for over 3 years when we had found out about this. I was the primary income for myself and my family and finding out about this tumor changed my life! I am no longer able to work at this time and working in the future is bleak at best. The problem with this particular brain tumor is that it was located at the speech center of my brain and now when I am upset or stressed in anyway I have a hard time articulating my words and sometimes am unable to speak at all. I know that this will get better over time and practice but it still affects how I perform my day to day life. After finding this out my life has changed drastically and it will no longer be the same. I will no longer be able to work in the healing industry due to the amount of stress and complex knowledge that it takes to get through the day. This is extremely hard for me considering that I have been a provider for my family and now am going to be struggling just to pay the house payment. It is hard for a woman of my pride to ask for help in these times, but without asking I fear not only will I lose everything I have worked so hard for, but I may not be able to complete the treatment that may save my life.I know that with the power of prayers and the kindness of people I will find a way to make it through this.  My daughter is helping me write this to you and I know that with your help I will be able to spend some more time with my family and get a chance to see my grandchildren grow up. Your help means more than words can say. Now since I have found out about this tumor I have finally stopped to smell the flowers and really started to appreciate the beauty that this life holds. And even though I may not be able to thank you in person or even with a card and a picture, what I promise to all those of you that help me, when I finish with the treatment and whatever funds are left on here I will pay it forward to someone else in need as I have always done, and now that I am unable to return to this industry, I feel that the best way for me to contribute is to helping another family. Thank you for your support, consideration, and help.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/safe-fencing-for-all-rescue-horses,Rescue in Need of New Fencing!,"Howdy from Beauty and the Beast Stables and Longhorns! My husband and I bought property nearly two years ago to accomodate our three rescue horses, and our popularity as a wonderful place to go for all abused, neglected, eldery, or unwanted animals has grown! It's wonderful that we have the opportunity to save and work with so many horses, cows, sheep, and goats, but we have come to the point where we have to install safer interior fencing. We believe in doing all the work ourselves, but the material alone to fence in 12 acres safely for horses, sheep, and goats is proving to be too much for us at the moment. We have already bought the materials for one whole acre of fencing (which is super safe with high tensile small square horse fencing and wood so that we can help wean orphaned babies, and keep all sheep and goats safe from predators). That project alone set us back over $4,000. Eventually (in roughly 8 years if I calculated correctly) we could install the other 11 acres of fencing, but we want to make sure everyone is perfectly safe right now! We are ready to get rid of all the old and put in the new! I know that is a lot of information, but we believe in being honest. The rough estimate (probably on the low side) of the remaining fencing and gates is roughly $30,000. Anything you, your friends, or family could contribute is highly appreciated! The picture above is of Leisl, our first BLM Wild Mustang from Oregon! Leisl came to us in November, never being touched by a human before, with no trust whatsoever! In just a short month of working very closely with her, she is now allowing me to stroke her all over and pick up her feet! This is huge a huge accomplishment for her, and we are super proud. This is just part of the work that we do here, and want to continue doing.

My cousin, Jason Boyd, had been feeling like he had the flu, so needless to say he was a little under the weather. Little did he know that it would rapidly escalate way beyond the common flu. He preceeded to run a fever over 104°. He got so weak and breathless that he asked to be taken to the hospital. Upon arrival, he was told his organs were already starting to shut down, and they took him straight to critical care. He was diagnosed with Strep group A, and ended up having one of the worst cases of pneumonia they had ever seen. He has been fighting for his life since that day. There were at least 2 times we thought he was going to leave us forever, but beyond our family and doctors beliefs, he has finally started to gradually come back to us! ( Though he is still in critical care today, a month later) This is only the beginning of his recovery, I know that his families struggles emotionally and financially will be ongoing for a long time and since Jason is responsible for his families main income, this is going to be one of the biggest areas of concern for their family during his recovery. I am establishing fundraising efforts through gofundme.com.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/baby-sailors-medical-expenses,Baby Sailor's Medical Expenses,"Eight months ago, my brother Dexter and his wife Brittany were graced with the wonderful news that they would be expecting another child together. Everything was great as they went to find out the gender of their baby. Unfortunately, finding out that their baby was a girl was the only good news they would hear. Dexter and Brittany were told that their little baby girl would have several complications, some of which would be life threatening. The doctor suggested that Brittany terminate the pregnancy. When Dexter and Brittany heard this, they had a decision to make. Should they terminate the pregnancy or push through many more months of a pregnancy that might not turn out the way they wanted? Dexter and Brittany never had to think when it came to this. They said, ""If God wants to take this baby, we'll let Him do it. We will not terminate this pregnancy.""      Seventeen weeks into her pregnancy, Brittany's water broke. Doctors told Brittany that she would most likely miscarry within a couple weeks. Even with this news, Dexter and Brittany never gave up, and neither did little Sailor.      Seven weeks ago, Brittany was admitted back into the hospital. Dexter and Brittany knew that this would be the best action to take to make sure their little girl could fight her way into our world.      On January 1, 2017, against all odds, sweet Sailor McKay Crosby made her grand entrance. She was born in a much better condition than any of the doctors ever expected. While, she is a miracle baby and improving every day, she is still fighting to survive in the NICU.     Due to  several weeks of staying in the hospital, Brittany has been unable to work. Along with the stress of one less paycheck, the medical expenses have grown to be outrageous. We ask that you can find it in your heart to help out in any way you can. First and foremost, we ask for your prayers. Sailor could not have made it to where she is today without the love and support of each and every one of you have given her. Secondly, we ask that you give what you can to help cover the expensive medical costs. Every dollar counts! Last, we ask that you share this with everyone you know.

Below is information about Jacksons issues & donation information. We are so thankful for the love and support Jackson and our family has received as we make it through this experience---we are blessed. As the situation unfolds, we continue to need support in many ways. As you can imagine the expense of the many tests, specialists, treatment and current hospitalization is adding up quickly. Additionally, we anticipate the need for home care, medical supplies (once home), and mandatory physical therapy (that's just what we know of now). We are asking for help with these expenses to soften any of the stress associated with this experience. For those that haven't read our posts:The reason Jackson is not active, is always sick, & always has some type of issue is because Jackson has silent aspirations which means most of his bottle from each feeding is going straight to his lungs instead of going to his stomach where it should be. He is too weak to realize that his feedings are doing what they are doing so we never knew anything until today, FIVE months after he's born. The doctors say only HALF an ounce out of each bottle of feeding he gets goes to his stomach the rest goes straight to his lungs. He has been doing this since birth according to doctors. He will have a feeding tube through his nose to his stomach for a while until this coming Friday. Friday he will have surgery to insert a ""G-Tube"" into his stomach and feed him that way. If y'all could keep us & Jackson in y'alls prayers through this experience that would be wonderful & helpful.

He amazed the doctors by how well he handled the surgery but his medical problems continued after he came home.  He is still under treatment for seizures.

Her pregnancy was perfectly normal and mom and baby had been healthy, Mary and dad-to-be Patrick were anxiously awaiting meeting him for the first time. She went to her last scheduled doctors appointment on December 27th for a routine checkup,  where she was told that her son no longer had a heartbeat. Sometime in the week since her last normal checkup he had passed away, 4 days before his due date. What this meant for my sister Mary is that she would have to be induced, and give birth to her deceased baby. On December 28th at 10:44am Mary had a natural birth and her son Grayson Peter Kovacs Miller was brought into the world surrounded by family. He was born 7lbs 14oz, 22 inches long and pure perfection. He had dark brown hair, sweet chubby cheeks and the most perfect lips and nose.

The ones who have been by your side your entire life and restored your hope in humanity over and over again? This page is in support of one of those humans. He’s a father, the best kind of father, my father. My dad has always been the kind of man who teaches girls they can be anything when they grow up and supports ideas he doesn't necessarily understand. The dad who you never doubt is your biggest fan. The kind who makes your best friends feel like family and does everything he can to help everyone around him thrive. When I was a child and funds were tight my dad used his bonus check from work to buy me a Barbie Jeep. That's the kind of man he is. He puts others happiness above his own, consistently. He makes sacrifices and puts himself out there to help others succeed. He connects with people on a level I've always admired and those who meet him are quick to want to be friends. I've accepted that it wouldn't be fair not to share him. He's the best kind of friend, the one you can call always and the one who won't forget to remember you. He's the person who makes other people feel special. I wish I could put his energy right in this space instead of trying to convey it in words, because realistically words could never contain the energy of this great of a man. A few months ago my superhero (so many people's hero) started feeling a little less than great after exerting himself at work. A throat pain that brought discomfort but not necessarily much concern. A few doctors appointments and a lot of pressure from us later and we found out this little pain was actually much more than we would have guessed on our own. It was a signal that his heart wasn't functioning at its best. I was pregnant at the time with his first grandchild (possible his only one as I'm his only child), and visits were spread out for months while we waited for more information. A couple weeks after the birth of my son my dad went to an appointment he didn't even want to attend because he had been feeling pretty alright. The result was news of multiple blockages and a procedure was scheduled for the next day. We went in with optimism and the desire to get over this hurdle with a couple of stents and newfound call to a deeper focus on health and a long happy life. Unfortunately it wasn't that easy, nothing could be done at that time. The blockages had hardened and couldn't be fixed with stents alone. My superhero is human. Another couple of weeks and he would speak to a heart surgeon about what could be done and what was going to happen next. Those weeks have passed and that day is today. Surgery was just scheduled for next week. Terrifying but hopeful life events, right? We’ll know more details of exactly what's happening after an MRI the day before the surgery itself. Hoping strongly for some good news there and of course for a complication free procedure and a quick recovery. I never thought I'd start one of these campaigns but my heart feels so called to reach out for my father today. He would never ask himself and we will figure everything out as a family no matter what of course, but I believe in the power of good intentions and the exchange of energy. My parents will be covering two years worth of deductibles and copays as this all has been spanning right over the new year. There is also a long recovery ahead in which he won't be able to work and my mother will also be taking extra time off. How amazing would it be to relieve some of this financial burden for them? I have no expectations going into this and only hope to spread positivity in the name of the greatest man I know. Whether it be a donation or a share it’s all appreciated and if nothing else - just hug someone who really deserves it today.",https://images.gofundme.com/_5tBLdXuQj-v3pdn2r-aPgoy__Q=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17206570_1483585675.0299.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Michelle Bennington is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Michael Bennington.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,750 raised of $5,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/f4-save-our-home,Save our home Of 20 Years!!!!,"Where to start… I guess over six years ago I developed severe arthritis in my legs and knees; it was so bad that I was barely able to walk. As a result, I had to retire from the Carpenters Union. My wife Cyndi was able to get a part-time job teaching cosmetology, in addition to working full-time as a stylist.  Our son graduated from high school and was accepted to the Golf Academy of America in Carlsbad. We promised him that no matter what happened, we would make sure he was able to graduate from college. Not only did he graduate, but he received the Presidents Award, the highest award given by the school. In fact, only he and one other student received this award.   While our son was in college, Cyndi lost her teaching job, which left us struggling to afford our son’s college tuition, in addition to making our mortgage payments and make ends meet.   I guess that’s when it got worse – while our son was still in college, I had to endure four major surgeries in about a 3 ½ year time period. This put a lot of stress my family. One of those surgeries was a partial knee replacement. The second surgery however was a total knee replacement on my left knee which didn’t go well. The doctor ended up having to implant a hinge replacement instead of a regular replacement in my knee because the bone around my knee had completely deteriorated. Then, about six months later, while working with the US Kids Golf Association, I slipped and fell and tore the entire patella out of my left knee. This resulted in major emergency surgery, and as a result, I was bedridden for quite some time. Then another six months later, I started losing the feeling in my hands. It was so bad that my hands would get completely numb and cold. Eventually the pain went up into my arms and shoulders, and I lost the feeling in both shoulders, and experienced excruciating pain in my neck. After going through many medical tests, including MRIs and CT scans, they determined that I needed neck surgery which involved removing the vertebrae from my neck, and then implanting two rods which would give my spinal column room to move.  Because I had to go through these numerous surgeries, we fell behind on our house payments. We talked to Wells Fargo and tried to work out a plan to get caught up on our payments. They refused to help and told us to contact Saveyourhome.org. We contacted this organization and they offered to pay $50,000 to Wells Fargo, but Wells Fargo refused to accept this payment since it was about $700 short (and they would not let us pay the $700).     My wife and I are both very involved in our community and in our church. I myself still work with the US Kids Foundation for the greater Los Angeles area, and I enjoy it very much. In addition, over the last 20 years we’ve been lucky to have adopted eight wonderful dogs. Some have passed on, but we still have four wonderful little dogs with us.  We’ve owned our house for over 20 years, and this is our retirement. We don’t want to lose our nest egg to a bank as a result of all of these tragedies we’ve endured.  We have suffered enough and just want to live the rest of our lives in our home. We are in dire need of assistance, and would be devastated if we lost our house.  In order to save our home, we need to raise about $75,000 by February 20, 2017. At this moment, the house is on the market. If it is not sold by February 24, 2017, Wells Fargo will foreclose and we will be homeless. And we are praying to God that this doesn’t happen.  Thank you for your time and patience, and for finding it in your hearts to help us. May God bless each and every one of you tenfold for your kindness and consideration. There have been many times in our lives and in our marriage where my wife and I have stepped out in faith and God has come through for us. And that’s what we are hoping for now – a miracle.

She flew to Florida to see her brother. She arranged for a caretaker for her dogs. But when she got home Breslin was dead and cold. She had been 2.5 pounds, but the vet said her poor little body only weighed 1 lb at death. The caretaker never visited the house. Betty had called to confirm that the dogs would be cared for on the day before she left. ""Yes,"" the caretaker said. Betty called during her vacation, because these four dogs each had special needs. ""Yes,"" the caretaker said, ""I just left your house, everything is fine."" But when Betty came home, one dog was dead, and the other three were on the brink of death. She had been gone 7 days. Betty is heartbroken. These dogs have been her companions since her husband passed. The surviving dogs, Markie, Windi, and Casey, were starving and dehydrated. Windi is a therapy dog for others. All three surviving dogs now need veterinary care almost daily.  Betty needs help paying for this care. Any contribution will be welcome.",https://images.gofundme.com/TxQ71tFQdNZg0W23kgPRzooA-WI=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17206782_1483586211.7661.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Betty Lewis is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$2,700 raised of $2,500 goal"

We returned home from a 2-week vacation yesterday, to a news story about a man freezing to death in front of business, less than 5 miles from where we live.  Having just come home from a tropical holiday, we were deeply impacted by this story. Imagine. The irony. And our privilege.After returning home from The Kindness Journey last year, a 12-month service project, my son felt drawn to learn more about homelessness and find ways to help the homeless in our community.Reading the news reports about what's happening right here in our beloved Portland have been tragic. How is it that we continue to let things like this happen?While my son and I have never had to live on the streets, we have been homeless. We understand in a deep and personal way, how Life can take you by surprise, spin you around in a way you could have never imagined, where you find yourself without your own safe, private place to call home.Honestly, since my son's declaration to work on homelessness, I haven't been able to get to a place of being 100% ""in"" with his choice, as his next social justice philanthropy project ... partially because there are soooo many things that have grabbed my heart and attention in the past few months that I want to support, but also because the issue of homelessness hits closer to home than I've wanted to sidle up next to.Up until now.When I read about the man that died 2 nights ago because he was alone enough in the world, that no one knew that he was out in the sub-freezing cold, I was jolted out my discomfort and now I'm 100% in and supporting my son's social justice work.Fast forward a few hours after reading yesterday's news reports ... I asked my son  what he wanted to do for his 14th Birthday coming up this weekend.He thought for a moment and said, what I'd really like to do is go to the Goodwill stores around Portland and buy up all their blankets, wrap them up in a special way and take them to the people and families that are in the homeless camps around the City.So, there you have it.Guess what we'll be doing this weekend!If you feel connected to the homelessness issue we are facing in our country and called to help out, we would appreciate your love, prayers, support and  ... >> Supply Donations: Blankets, Coats, Hats, Mittens and Gloves for men, women and very sadly, also for children*>> We welcome and appreciate financial donations to purchase the above>> Gift Wrappers: If we have time we'd love helping wrapping the blankets with love, some small food and personal care items>> Delivery AngelsI also welcome and invite any ideas in how to mobilize and pull this off in just a couple of days and inviting in ease, a double-dose of Grace and the love and support of our Community.May it be so and blessings abound.Love,A&J*I've reached out to local business as collection points.  Stay tuned for my info.",https://images.gofundme.com/CVwRo3zAaQL3dbeLejvUkzGIZlw=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17206892_1483587654.9728.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Amanda Winn is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"$1,500 raised of $1,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/vickskidneyisfailing,Vick's Kidney is Failing But.....,"We’ve resisted doing this for a long time, but we need the help of our community, friends, and family more than we’ve ever needed it before. Our father has kidney disease and gets dialysis three times a week.  He is at the end of his options and things feel hopeless and dark at this point.  He’s been on a waiting list for a kidney donor for six years and the average wait time for his blood type is about nine years.  We do not have the time left to keep waiting. Our one and only option, our only hope is to seek a kidney transplant where organ donors are more common among larger populations of donors resulting in shorter wait times.  We’re not ready to lose my father and he is not ready to go.  We’ve watched a great person endure immense suffering for far too long and that’s why we need to reach out to all of you. Our father has taught us to live life to the fullest, to hope and dream, to laugh, care, and love. Even though his kidney is failing, his heart has never failed us. We hope to light his life in this time of darkness. We need him at our weddings one day; we need him to be able to look his grandchildren in the eyes.  Our only hope is the love of the community and our friends and family. His condition can be cured with a kidney transplant.  If you can help us reach our goal of finding my father a new kidney, you will have helped us find a future with my father in it; we can’t bear it any other way. His condition is worsening daily and we have no other choice but to ask this of you all.  We will forever be indebted to the love and support you can give to us.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/strength-for-sid,Sid's Strength Fund,"Hi, and thanks for reading about my dad's story. Here it goes.We are from Texas and my dad travels for work doing pool table recovery, repair, and installation. On the night of October 11th he was outside of his vehicle in Memphis when suddenly a man came up behind him and started brutally assaulting him with a hammer (he was parked RIGHT in front of the pool hall). The man didn't say he wanted anything from my dad, he just began to brutally assault him. My dad, at 63 years old, managed to turn around and fight the guy off, even after sustaining several blows to the head, abdomen, and hand. At some point during my dad's selfdefense, the guy swung his hammer and the claw part of the hammer caught my dad on his right hand in between his pinky and ring finger and nearly ripped my dad's pinky off. After fighting the guy off, my dad was able to miraculously run inside of the pool hall where they called 911 and he was transported to a Memphis hospital. By the grace of God, my dad thought to call my uncle and aunt on their landline (while he was in the ambulance) because he knew my mom, nor any of us kids, would have heard our cell phones ring, as we usually silence them before bed. My husband and I  got a call just after midnight from my uncle that my dad had been brutally attacked with a hammer and he was being transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. My heart instantly sank. In the wee hours of the morning, I began googling to try and figure out what hospital they would have brought him to. Thankfully I was able to talk to someone in the emergency room at Saint Francis Hospital who let my dad know that we would like him to call us ASAP. While all of this is going on, my uncle was booking a plane ticket to leave Austin first thing the next morning and my brother was driving an hour from college to my parent's house to go wake up my mom, as she was not answering her phone. Finally, I was able to get ahold of my dad who sounded sad, discombobulated, and hurt. This was by far the most hurt I've ever felt. The attacker smashed his glasses, so he was not able to see anything. He was alone and in severe pain hundreds of miles away from his family. To say we were all sick that night is an understatement. There was my big, strong, burley dad sounding so sad and defeated over something he had no control over; over a freak act that the attacker has yet to pay for. As the hours went on, my dad underwent several tests and it was determined that he did not have a concussion (how?!!), but he would receive several stitches in his head to close the multiple gashes left from the hammer. When I talked to him, he said his hand was hurting him the most and that would be a much bigger issue than a few stitches. As the night continued, our whole family here in Texas awaited answers. I woke up the next morning and decided to call the hospital, as we had not heard anything for several hours. I talked to a very nice nurse who told me that my dad would have to stay to meet with an orthopedic surgeon to figure out the route to take to repair his hand. Longer story short: the surgery would have to take place in Texas because my dad's self-employment insurance was not going to cover the out of state costs. The morning of the 12th a detective came by to speak with my dad. They informed my dad that the attacker's phone had fallen out of his pocket and, because of that, they were extremely hopeful that they would catch the guy. They also were able to obtain video evidence, so in our eyes, this would be an easy case.Throughout the next few days, my dad and uncle drove back from Memphis (my uncle went, instead of my mom, because my dad had his boat with him and my mom can't drive the truck with the boat behind it), my dad visited several doctors in Austin to schedule a surgery to repair his hand, and my whole family prayed that the attacker would be found and justice would be served.On October 20th my dad had extensive hand surgery to repair a broken hand and several nerves and tendons that were literally ripped apart during the attack. My dad, who's job requires manual labor, was out of work for several weeks with no disability coverage. After the surgery he was informed that he would most likely never have any motion in his right pinky again. To this day, he is still not able to move that finger and the strength in his right hand is about 1/3 of that in his left.It is the new year and the terrible man who attacked my dad is still roaming the streets. The police know EXACTLY who he is. They have him on video! My dad is truly the most kind, generous, giving human and it makes me physically sick thinking that the Memphis Police Department keeps pushing my dad's case to the side like it doesn't matter. My dad has no idea this fund is set up, but my family and I would love to be able to raise funds to help my dad with the medical costs from this attack. My parents have forked over thousands of dollars for the ambulance ride, CT scans, hand surgery, physical therapy, and multiple other procedures and exams my dad has had to have because of this freak accident.Also, since my dad is self-employed and his job is 100% manual labor, he has not be able to return to work fully. His contract employer has provided him with an assistant to help him on the job, but they are only paying for the assistant until February. My dad's hand is still far from healed, meaning he is going to have to start paying this man to help him out of his own pocket because there is no way he can do the job alone. If anything, we ask that you say a prayer that they catch the person who did this to my dad. It has truly been a nightmare for my family and we'd love to start the New Year out with the whole ordeal in the past.Thanks,Sarah T. Daughter of Sid",https://images.gofundme.com/sYoChJzrcsyXbjn5wMSCW_6HPL4=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207050_1483587008.0922.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Sarah Tucker is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of SID ISENBERG.,Accidents & Emergencies,"$1,880 raised of $10,000 goal"

She will be leaving the last week of May for a June 1st appointment!  March 16, 2017: Kristina had to leave the outpatient brain neurological program at Mayo on Friday March 10, 2017 because she lacked the funds to continue to pay for lodging, meals and transportation. She is back in Indiana waiting for her doctors there to pick up her treatment. If anyone wants to send cards or packages,  her address is 8234 Forsythia Ct,  Room 1, Indianapolis, IN 46219. She will be traveling to the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio once plans are set.  Please continue to send gifts. Financial Gifts may also be sent to her paypal account at Kzootaxlady@gmail.com.   Update: Kristina has been at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota since January 24, 2017. The plan is to get her home by the end of February to the beginning of March. Please keep your donations coming. The first 3 days of study at Mayo cost $13,576! If anyone wants to send Kristina cards or care packages, her address is: Neurological Recovery House, C/O Kristina Hornaday-Alberts, 839 2nd St, SW, Red Rm, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902.  Financial Gifts may also be sent to her paypal account at Kzootaxlady@gmail.com.   On June 21, 2016, Kristina woke up  to start her day and she couldn't feel her right leg or walk to the bathroom.  She went to the emergency room at the hospital and through a series of CT Scans and MRI's, it was discovered that she had an ischemic stroke.  Her left leg was paralyzed and she could not walk. All in one quick moment, her whole life had changed.   Kristina was only 41 years old when this happened. Her blood pressure was dangerously high.   She was admitted to the hospital where she ended up having a second ischemic  stroke just a couple of days later on the 24th of June.   It was found that she also had excess cerebral fluid around her brain. They did a spinal tap to remove the fluid around her brain and worked closely to stablize her condition.  She was unconscious for several days.   Kristina had a third ischemic stroke a few weeks later which paralyzed her whole right side arm, hand, leg and foot and ended up spending the whole summer of 2016 in the hospital in various acute rehabiliation units for intensive neurological therapy. She was moved to a sub acute rehabilitation/nursing facility at the end of August 2016 and was there through October 2016. She spent months learning how to use her limbs again. Daily therapies pushing through to the next day.   In October of 2016, a Cerebral Angiogram was performed and it was reported that she had severe narrowing of the arteries and blood vessels in her brain.  Her team of medical professionals have been working steadily running tests to determine the underlying cause of the stenosis of the arteries. In December of 2016, it was found by her hemotologist that she has a genetic condition predisposing her to blood clots.   In early January of 2017, Kristina had a 4th Ischemic stroke effecting the left side of her brain and the right side of her body. Her vision in her right eye has been dramatically effected. Kristina has been in intensive outpatient neurological therapy including physical, occupational, lymphatic and speech/cognitive therapy. She has not been able to work or conduct her business and has not had an income since May of 2016. The expenses are piling up and her team of neurologists at Indiana University Health Neuroscience department as well as her medical team at St. Vincent Health have recommended she be referred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Her case is very complex and they still have not found the reason why she had the strokes. She has several health conditions that are playing a part of her downfall in her health.   The Mayo Clinic has accepted her complex medical case and she will be headed that way on January 24, 2017. With the loving support of her friends, which are her only family support, Kristina needs assistance to help pay for the trip to Mayo clinic and to help pay for all her medical expenses. The expenses include transportation, lodging, food, and parking while she's  there. Kristina has no family to assist her as her parents both passed in prior years. Kristina took care of her Mother until she passed away from stage 4 colon cancer in October of 2014. Kristina's Father passed away in April of 2007.   How can you help?  Kristina is overwhelmed by the HUGE financial burden that has been placed on her by this unexpected tragedy in her life as well as not having an income over all of her recovery time. She has had enormous expenses for medical equipment from wheelchairs, walkers, AFO brace, lymphatic pump, compression stockings, orthopedic shoes, knee braces, ankle brace, as well as all of the doctor visits with copays and tests.  Insurance does not cover everything and she's barely surviving.   Kristina is in intensive therapy weekly to work on all of her deficits as the result of her strokes.  She is suffering from hemiplegia and spasticity on her right side.  We ask you to please consider blessing her as she makes this trip to Mayo Clinic to finally get some answers to her health crisis. We are hoping it drastically changes her quality of life.     Thank you for your blessing and we will keep you updated on her condition and status!",https://images.gofundme.com/EFf3FXiD0n7sds4CkuPg1Lwe-x0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207080_1484429061.3903.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Kristina May Hornaday-Alberts is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,675 raised of $25,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-chris-from-cleveland,"Helping Chris, a CLE Homeless Man","I met Chris outside of Starbucks one week before Christmas. I go to that Starbucks every week, and had never seen him there before. I'm ashamed to say I usually look past - and completely avoid - people like Chris, but something about the way he was sitting on the corner, cold and alone, caught my eye. Call it Christmas spirit, fate or God, but something called me to go talk to Chris and I'm so thankful I did.Chris is well-spoken, grateful and positive. He's down on his luck, but he's sober and trying to pick himself up at one of the lowest points in his life. He has no place to go, and very few people in his life who can help him.That day outside of Starbucks, I gave Chris a little money and my phone number, if he ever desperately needed more help. Not once has he asked for anything, yet the couple times I've met back up with him to help him out, he is extremely grateful, and kind, and has offered to help me if ever I need it. Chris used to work with computers, but is willing to do ANY work he can to make money - he in fact prefers that, and has offered to shovel my driveway, or do any other odd jobs I can think of to earn the money I gave him. Because I haven't been able to come up with a job for Chris, and am only one person, I'm reaching out to you - my friends, family, coworkers, friends of friends - for any help you can provide - be it money, ideas for odd jobs for Chris to do, places for him to stay, whatever.It's January, and it's extremely cold in Cleveland. There is one sober house that Chris goes to, where they provide a bed, food and showers for $20 / day. My goal is to raise enough money for Chris to stay at that place every single day until Cleveland's cold winter is over. And if we can raise more, then to buy him food and a computer, so he can get back on his feet.I appreciate any help we all can provide to Chris. I don't do this kind of crowdsourcing thing - in fact, have NEVER done this - before, but something in my heart is calling me to ask for help for a man who is too humble to ask for it on his own.

Over the last 6 years running the project I have worked with incredible people - but not many come more inspiring then Billa Mahmud from the Future Leaders Underprivileged Children's Center in Accra, Ghana. A fearless leader in ensuring the mission of the GFP is fulfilled within his soccer academy, when unexpectedly Billa tragically passed away in December 2016, we were truly heartbroken. The Inspiring LeaderBilla Mahmud was a family man and an advocate for education providing over 190 children with free schooling through his center. To be a part of one of his largely sought-after soccer teams, 100% attendance in school was a must. Day in and day out Billa dedicated his time and money to give children and teens the opportunity to develop into a professional players while reinforcing the importance of an education. With the financial and coaching support of GFP, Billa was able motivate and develop players into role models for the community. In 2016 one of the graduates Bernard Tekpetey was called up to the Ghana national team. This goes to show that not only is the soccer field in the heart and soul of Accra, but Billa was too. MissionOn Jan 28th I will be traveling to Ghana to help put sustainable plans in place for the soccer program to continue after the passing of Billa. I will be educating and supporting the programs coaches to ensure the great work Billa did carries on and continue to raise awareness of human trafficking in soccer.

Born and raised in a small town just outside of Accra, he knew poverty and it's affects first hand. Recognising the need for change he started teaching children, who were not in any form of education, basic Maths and English underneath a mango tree. Billa understood how to engage children and inspire them to learn and change their own destiny. The project grew organically over the next 18 years to what it is today; a school of 196 children with many more in Junior HIgh and Senior HIgh education. He also set up football teams for different age groups to encourage positive behaviour and team work and recognised the need to help families in setting up small businesses. His good will, generosity and ambition to make a difference spread far and wide and touched so many people's lives in his short time on Earth. Shortly before he died, Billa saw the beginnings of his dream come true in the form of a permanent school structure. This school will make a difference to hundreds more childrens' lives and will be a lasting legacy of his work. Please help us to continue Billa's legacy by donating whatever you can. https://www.facebook.com/FutureLeadersUCC/?fref=tshttps://www.facebook.com/Future-Leaders-Football-Project-778453328876201/?fref=tsGhana Football Project: Ghana Football Project was established in January 2011 by 2 UEFA-qualified football coaches from Preston, Lancashire. The project aims to spread awareness of and combat the issue of illegal academies that cause human trafficking. Such academies lure players abroad under the promise of a trial with a professional club - a trial that never exists. Talented youngsters are then stranded with little hope of a future.Ghana Football Project aims to help safe, legal academies one at a time to gather all the necessary support in order to generate a sustainable income and become self-sufficient. The project works to improve the standard of youth football in Ghana and to combat the issue of illegal academes and corrupt agencies, by providing and assisting in the provision of education, training and equipment necessary for progress within the sport. We also aim to raise awareness of the issue of illegal academies and the destruction that they can cause.https://www.facebook.com/ghanafootballproject/",https://images.gofundme.com/YPVV4pIu4_TZuV_9_37JOJ4Pg2E=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483593705.0057.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483592947.421_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483745065.7664_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483745019.6223_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483592987.7067_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483593010.6969_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483593030.5933_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483593046.36_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17207442_1483593118.6719_funddescription.jpg']",8,"Created January 4, 2017",Lee Kellett is organizing this fundraiser.,"Sports, Teams & Clubs","$12,615 raised of $10,000 goal"

I am insurmountably distraught after having received news that my big sister has been diagnosed with uterine endometrial cancer. Due to severe complications with a uterine prolapse and an emergency surgery, the medical expenses have been growing exponentially for her and her wife Babylyne Isa. In between awaiting various insurance approvals for medical bills, and attending never ending screenings and doctors appointments to determine just how far the cancer has spread, she has also been unable to work. Heather and Babylyne have a 2 year old adopted daughter Cori and have also unselfishly taken temporary custody of 3 other children who were in need of care. With 4 little ones, all under 8 years old, and Babylyne's elderly mother, they have a full house of people who all depend on them.  Unfortunantly, Heather will be unable to work for at least another 2 months until her required hysterectomy is completed. Funding from insurance for potential future surgeries has not yet been confirmed and any support provided would be absolutely welcomed and greatly appreciated. I have decided to open a gofund me campaign because I know that Heather and Lyne are too proud to ask for help, even though they are so quick to give it to others. I know that their medical expenses have been tremendous, even with help from insurance. They are also having problems getting approval for temporary disability and can use any help they can get.

Link below:http://www.khou.com/features/the-love-story-of-two-parents-and-a-miracle-baby/381353316 Family, friends, and well wishers, I want to start by sharing the story of our miracle baby, Lucas, with you. Our family's journey began early on when Lilly and I decided that we were ready to have a child. At 34 years old, we knew our time was limited but our love was strong. Upon seeing a fertility doctor, we learned that Lilly was unable to conceive naturally due to medical reasons. Unfortunately, after a successful surgery our outcome still remained the same. The scarring was too extensive. As hard as this news was for us to bare, we still remained hopeful. We explored the option of IVF. After 2 attempts, with the first being unsuccessful, we were pregnant! All was well until roughly 20 weeks when Lilly started feeling contractions. From this point on we would find ourselves back in the Triage several times off and on until week 24. Scheduled to be discharged later that day, Lilly went on a tour of the NICU at the Texas Children’s Hospital per the doctor’s recommendation to ambulate. Unexpectedly, neither Lilly nor Lucas could hold on. In the very NICU room that Lucas stays today, Lilly went into labor. Due to complications, an emergency C-section was required. 30 minutes later, Lucas was born at 1 lb. 12 oz. on October 28.  It has been a little over 2 months and Lucas is now 4 lbs. 4 oz. He has been diagnosed with moderate/severe BPD (chronic lung disease), Grade 1 IVH (brain bleed), PFO (small hole in the heart), Stage 2 ROP (abnormal development of the blood vessels in the eyes), and an inguinal hernia.  Our son is a fighter and we love him so much! Each and every day he is trying his best to heal and grow. Since he’s been born, we’ve been by his side at the hospital night and day for 10 weeks and counting and we intend on being here with him every step of the way until he can come home with us. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about our son’s impact on our world. Below, I’ve included a link to a video and interview from our local news station that explains a little bit more about our story. Love story of two parents and a miracle baby 'We Wanted to Get Married Here, With Him'  Houston couple marries in hospital New Year’s Day in honor of son born prematurely Please share our story with all of your friends!

For those who long for children, we understand that desire.My wife and I have been together almost eight years. We have been married for almost three of the years, and we both have come that point in our lives that we want and are ready to have kids. The reality is that we have not been successful due to my inability to have children through the normal process. The other reality is that an in vitro procedure is very expensive, and we simply don’t have the resources to pay for it.Our last resort is the generosity of kind individuals who understand our pain and are willing offer their support. We've done as much as we can as far as blood work and tests, but we still need $20,000 to start the in vitro process. The procedure is not covered under insurance so we have to pay out of pocket and – as much as we are willing – we cannot get approved for a loan so large.My name is Dean(Scott) Russell. I am originally from Altmar, NY (a small town north of Syracuse, NY). After serving six years on active duty in the US Navy and another two in the California Army National Guard, I started working in the education field, specifically in recruitment. I am currently an Admissions Manager with Cengage Learning's Ed2Go department. My wife Christina Russell was born in Oregon and raised partially there and Orange County, California. She is a Registered Veterinarian Technician (RVT) and has been in the veterinary field for over 15 years now.We both come from large families and are still very closely connected to them. As much as we love each other, we also want to share our love with children of our own and give them the nurturing environment that our families gave to us. We are both fully involved in the world around us and are eager to introduce our children to the experiences we have enjoyed together as a couple.The heartbreak of infertility is difficult to describe. The American Pregnancy Association has reported that one in ten couples experience infertility. So infertility is not that uncommon. It is one of the most stressful experiences that a couple can face in their lifetime. We can attest to that. Celebrations like Mother's Day and Father’s Day emphasize the emptiness of our home and in our hearts.There are those out there that have kids and don't want anything to do with them. Then there are those that want kids and can't have them. This is an unfortunate thing both parents and children. We have so much to offer a child – our love and devotion of course – but we also are in position to offer a stable, loving home with a whole contingency of devoted relatives.Children are our future. Please help us achieve the goal of having a child to love. If you are a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, you know how each child enriches a family. It is really a gift of life, and your generosity will have a lifelong impact – not only to us – but to the child we wish to hold in our arms.If you are unable to help financially, please at least share our story with your friends and family on social media so that those that may have the ability to help, can.With love,Dean & Christina Russell￼",https://images.gofundme.com/edLMr5N6g1W8SYhUhhrpJO_RSss=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17208248_154761438825170_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 23, 2017",Christina Russell is organizing this fundraiser.,"Babies, Kids & Family","$320 raised of $20,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/malisas-medical-fundraiser,Malisa's Medical Fundraiser,"In August of 2015 I started having vision problem and severe fatigue. I assumed it was age and that I needed glasses. Then, I started having headaches and walking into walls. On November 2nd, of 2015, I was having trouble articulating my words and my girl-friend encouraged me to go to the ER. My husband, Kurt, and I just thought I was fatigued from working so many hours and driving all the hours for my work. Kurt took me to the ER because they would not see me at the clinic; an MRI was done, and they found a massive tumor in my back left lobe. I was transported by ambulance to Abbott Northwestern and underwent two surgeries; the first surgery was to cut the blood flow to the tumor and lasted 10 hours. The second surgery was to remove the tumor and lasted 11 hours. The type of tumor was a Hemangiopericytoma, grade II - a rare, aggressive, cancerous, tumor. It's known to come back in 1 of 3 people (anywhere in the body). They were able to remove all of the tumor, however in doing so they had to remove a bit of brain tissue that the tumor was attached to which effected my short-term memory and peripheral vision loss in my right eye. Because of this type of tumor I would need to be scanned semi-regularly.   So then, in December 6th, 2016, I had my regular scheduled scans. They found another tumor (we do not know if it is the same tumor yet, we are waiting on the pathological report).  This tumor was located deeper in my brain where the left and right lobe meet. They were able to remove the tumor successfully on the 28th of December (at KU Med - as my husband's job had transferred him to Kansas).  I will need radiation, possible chemo, and will need to be scanned quarterly as there is no guarantee when (or if) it will come back.   Before my first surgery, I worked for Lasson Management as a property manager working my way up to being an assistant regional manager for 10 years. I worked full time, over 40 hours a week most weeks. Against my doctor's orders I tried to get back in the swing of my job - he did not want me working and advised against it. However I soon realized I could no longer handle what my job entailed. Upon coming to Kansas I figured getting a less stressful job would be easier for me to handle so I got a job as a Host/Server.   The funds will help keep us current on our regular day to day bills and help pay towards my medical bills and perscriptions.

Thank God, no one was harmed in the fire that ripped through the 5000 block of Buffalo Run in Westerville, OH.While everyone was back to work and school after the Christmas Holiday in my son's household, someone in the apartment complex decided to burn their Xmas tree in their fireplace. A fire broke out and because of high winds, spread very quickly. Once the Fire Department arrived, there were issues with the water supply.The management and staff of Remington Station Apartments and Crawford Homes graciously allowed the family the use of a furnished demo apartment complete with linens through this weekend. They have worked diligently to offer vacant apartments to the families that lost their homes. We are very grateful for their efforts!The family has lost everything. They don't even have a change of clothes for tomorrow. The children had a Christmas that they will only be able to remember in their memories. The youngest child is barely 6 months old.

Aunt Jane is turning 95 this year and I am hoping you will help me celebrate her birthday!I asked Aunt Jane about giving her a 95th birthday party and perhaps doing something like we did before, but she was reluctant because it brought back sad memories of Janet, who was instrumental in planning the previous birthday celebration. She told me that I would think she was crazy, but that her real dream was to go to Hawaii one more time before she dies. She said that all she wanted was to have a hotel room with a lanai that overlooked the ocean and she wanted to actually be looking out at the ocean on her big day! Of course I told her that it was not a crazy idea and that I believed she could do it. She said she could afford somewhere around $2500 for the trip.  I found her dream trip with all her desires, but  the total cost was $3500 because of needing to break up the trip so that she didn't have to travel 21 hours straight. This necessitated an additional round trip ticket and hotel accommodations both ways.  I have booked the trip from March 11-20, 2017,  so that she can be sitting on that lanai looking out at the ocean on March 16th, her actual birthday! She will be staying at the Aston Mahana at Kaanapali which is oceanfront and has a lanai :)I thought it would be a great idea if all of us who love her could help with the cost of her trip. We don't have to raise all of the funds, but whatever we raise together would go a long way toward helping her with her dream.  Most of us would probably  buy her a gift anyway, but I am hoping that instead of a gift, that you consider donating to this cause to make her dream come true.I would like to collect the funds as soon as we are able. March 1st is the deadline .  If you are unable to help, or want to help, but need to give after March 1, just let me know. It is no pressure! She does not know that I am doing this. It is a surprise! Once we get the donations in, I will present her with a card with all of our names on it! My memories of Aunt Jane are special. She has always been there for all of us and I would love it if we could show her how much we love and appreciate her by helping to provide this trip for her! She is our matriarch! Please help me honor her! Thank you all so much for your kind help with this! Also, please send this to anyone you know that knows and loves Aunt Jane. I am sending this to those of you whose email I have, but I don't know everyone's.Much love to everyone!

After completion of a degree in Linguistics at Michigan State University, I entered the Institute, and am in my second year of seven at the Institute's Seminary of St Philip Neri nestled in the beatiful Tuscan hills outside of Florence, Italy.This past year, I received the cassock and the Tonsure. The Tonsure is the ceremony of the Church which creates a cleric. During the ceremony, a choir chants Dominus pars hereditatis meis, et calicis meae, tu es qui restitues hereditatem meam mihi, ""The Lord is my heredity and my chalice, Thou art He who restores my heredity unto me.""  After this ceremony, I no longer wear lay clothes, suit, tie. Now I wear the cassock, the ""livery of the Church,"" and so, after the reception of the cassock, there are generally more expenses initially than later, to have the necessary cassocks, and other clerical clothing.Reception of the surplice from the hands of the bishop, after Tonsure (one of the five parts visible above the ear).In addition to the regular tuition of $1,200 per month, there are many  other costs.

Henry the Hernia Must GO!,"I would like to talk to you today about something very close to my heart, and when I say “close to my heart,” I mean that quite literally. Let me introduce you to Henry.  Who is Henry, you’re probably wondering?  Well, Henry is what I not-so-affectionately call my umbilical hernia. That’s right, he’s been such a painful and persistent presence in my life, I gave him a name.Maybe you’re wondering what an umbilical hernia is or you’re thinking, isn’t that something babies get? Those are both excellent questions! An umbilical hernia happens when the stomach muscles don’t join completely and the intestine or other tissues bulge through this weak spot. And yes, this is something that happens to babies! But it can also happen to adults, and when it does, the pain and discomfort can be very intense.While umbilical hernias tend to fix themselves over time in infants, they most often require surgery when they happen to adults. After a few years of “dealing with it” the pain has become more frequent and intense. I’ve been advised that surgery is needed before further complications occur, such as hernia strangulation, which can ultimately be fatal.In early December, my wife Candyce underwent spinal fusion surgery, so our finances have already been over-extended on medical expenses, and a new year means a new deductible to meet.No one enjoys asking for help, but since hernia surgery is considered an “elective” surgery, the hospital won’t offer a payment plan. The goal amount will help me reach my insurance deductible.Any donation is greatly appreciated. If you can't make a donation, please help spread the word. Thank you!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/juliagoredbyaboar,HELP! Farmer Julia gored by a boar!,"The very attributes that make a good farmer, like strength, perseverance, stubbornness, determination & grit can work against you sometimes. What if the word help has never been in your vocabulary? Or if it has, it’s a 4-letter word at best. What if you are “the FORCE”? Then there is no way to be able to say, “May the FORCE be with YOU”. What if your mindset is “Failure is not an option?” Yet we know that learning occurs by making mistakes, failing, and falling off our proverbial bikes. Perhaps you’ve read that Margaret Mead quote a zillion times, “never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed it’s the only thing that ever has”…and then you thought, “yah right… I can do it, I can do it by myself”. And then just before Christmas, in the midst of a cold snap the likes of which no one has seen for 40 years, after far too many sleepless nights in the barn with newborn piglets, your electric fence freezes up, your 1000lb boar escapes and you foolishly get in the way of his 6 inch razor sharp tusks which rip most of the way through your abdomen and into your liver. You are whisked to the hospital for surgery and everyone says, “You should be dead! You are the Christmas miracle! You truly are. And oh, by the way in 2 years you will be healed up to 80% of your former FORCE self.” What do you do? What do you do when your livelihood as a trustworthy, ethical, and nurturing farmer is now on hold? What do you DO? What do YOU DO?That’s when your posse of the folks about which Margaret Mead speaks say, “What do you need? How can we help?” And then YOU, Farmer Julia, bump into yourself and begin to contemplate the power of the people. And with the help of your friends, YOU, FARMER Julia realize, I NEED (gulp, 4-letter-word) HELP!!!I am Dawn. I am a teacher. I am Julia’s friend. We were new mummies together, over 20 years ago. I KNOW Julia. I REALLY know Julia. And as I sit here in my warm Kitsilano home, I know my pal needs HELP. She needs BIG strong, rough and tough HELP. I want to give you the opportunity to HELP my friend, and the FORCE Farmer Julia.This GoFundMe campaign is to raise funds to HELP Julia pay a worker to fill her BIG shoes, and to help with the unexpected expenses resulting from an extraordinarily difficult winter at the ranch. Julia will NOT be able to return to her FORCE work in a BIG way, for at least 2 years. Yes she can sit at a desk, but that’s NOT our Farmer Julia. She’s out there on the land doing work that most of us (men and women) couldn’t or wouldn’t do. It’s Time… Step up and be counted… Julia did but now she can’t… Get out that e-cheque book and HELP. Farmers like Julia deserve nothing less.LinksYou can read about Julia’s business Urban Digs at www.urbandigsfarm.com You can read a more detailed account of the accident here You can read news coverage and see more photos and video on CBC.The tasiest way you can support Julia is to buy a side of pork! They have a lot of pigs that are market ready now and a big feed bill to pay.Photos (nice ones first... don't scroll past the first 3 pictures if you are squeamish!)Julia & William in better timesJulia with one of William's offspringStaff meeting in the barnOk now for the gorey pictures.... nothing too terrible. No was was taking pictures until Julia was out of the woods but they are still pretty gross:This is the hole in Julia's abdominal wallThis is the hole in Julia's liverCleaning the wound the day after surgery.  The surgeon stitched Julia up internally but left the wound open so it could be cleaned, to allow it to drain, and to hopefully reduce the very high risk of infection.The original wound was a round hole 12cm in diameter.

That is an extra cost of $300. per month.       These levels of Lead are Lethal if not addressed immediately.  So the IV Ozone is put off for a few more weeks then I will do one day Chelation IV, and the other day IV Ozone Treatment.  I had my 7th full Chelation last Wednesday (Feb 22nd) but I'm feeling ill, Agony with Pain and full of Inflammation.         So Monday they want me to have Myers Cocktail (Vitamins, Minerals) IV as I'm showing signs of severe Edema (swelling from inflammation).  Wednesday March 1st, I'll have my   8th Chelation IV.  Monday March 6th I will see the doctor for an Office visit to discuss the next protocol and have LAB Blood-work done to see how far my Lead levels have come down.   Will keep everyone posted.  Thanks for sharing my GoFundMe page and/or Donating to my health.  Many Thanks, Prayers and Love <3  Alisa               1997 I was rear-ended in an auto accident after dropping my son to school First grade. I was almost 35 yrs old. Resulted in 7 knee surgeries, one with a DVT Blood clot but finally receiving a total knee replacement in 2003.       Limping for seven years ruined my spine. My gait was way off.  After having the clot I was confined to a CPM Machine for 8-10 hour per day due to the blood clot from Thanksgiving until New Year's Day (1999 or 2000). Then a walker, then a cane along with Crutches then physical therapy after that.      No one wanted to touch me at BWH for fear of dislodging the clot.      I was always a do-er always moving very upbeat and positive. Now total agony and losing hope. My only child Mathew was such a joy to be with, but his younger years he was my caretaker as my husband had to work 16 hour days 7 days a week to make up for all the medical bills I incurred from being hurt.      Still trying for more children when our son was two yrs old. I had four miscarriages (one reaching 18 weeks) BWH infertility realized after a year and a half of treatments and biopsies, I had no problem getting pregnant the issue was my body would attach the fetus as a foreigner matter.      Even had my DNA test done and it came back with an extra chromosome with every 26th counted the 27th was the extra chromosome.      October of 1997 we were going to become foster Parents did everything and passed with flying colors. We only had the home study left. I told my husband let's wait until after the Holidays and January the homestudy would be done.      The car accident was December 23rd right before Christmas. ( Also during this time my Mother had early onset of Alzheimer's (early 50's) she had a hard very dysfunctional life childhood through adulthood dealing with an alcoholic Father then Alcoholic Husband, with 6 kids to feed. I'm the youngest of the six I just turned 55 two days after Christmas 2016.      My Father had a stroke at 54 yrs and three years later he committed Suicide. I was 27 yrs old and just getting over an abusive marriage.        Dec 1997 until now I've been to many Specialists, infectious Disease Doctor, Holistic doctors, many tests bloodwork, CT Scans MRI's. Could never afford a Pet scan. I did find out this year, that Contrast Never leaves the human body.     With all the hospital work ups and ER visits I'm sure it's in me.   In early 1998 I was diagnosed with Raynaud's disease. Stayed in Massachusetts as long as I could, even staying inside for weeks on end.    Still no blood in hands or toes.     I was told to move to a warmer climate either Arizona or Florida before I start losing digits (fingers, toes ears and nose).      I started coming to Naples in 2000 stayed in a motor home and homeschooled my son. The school system said he had ""Auditory Processing"" issues. They said he wasn't Special Ed enough that the money they get has to go to the most disabled children. Understandable, but letting my only child fall through the cracks was not an option.  He was tested outside the school and they confirmed it but the school never changed his work load according or gave him extra help he needed.      That's when my Raynaud's and my Son's Auditory Processing came together. Motorhome and curriculum headed to Florida. Where we began 4th grade. (He had four sets of tubes in his ears from chronic ear infections and tonsils and adenoids out all before the age of eight.)      We spent the colder months January thru April in the beginning. Then we would leave before Christmas as the winters seemed to get colder earlier every year. So Raynaud's was my first diagnosis.   ~~~~Fast forward to now 2016 but year after year something else major would happen to me. I felt my central nervous system was compromised. Reading and comprehending was almost gone. I felt like my brain was disconnecting from my body. Couldn't find words, I'd stutter, have tremors. tip over, can't add numbers. Short term memory gone. Frustration fits. drop things continuously. Losing all control of my body. The blood brain barrier had been compromised and was still full of viruses, fungus, bacteria and co infections from late Lyme and Candida overgrowth.        They All die off when they come in contact with the Oxygen (02 + 03) Thats why I need IV Ozone Therapy.      I still have Raynaud's disease, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, PTSD, Irritable bowel Syndrome 5 yrs IBS-D now last 15 yrs IBS-C., Diverticulitis, Candida Overgrowth for the 4th time, Late Lyme, Leaky gut., asthma off and on...since age 23.      Vegas Nerve is being pinched off in many places, Lower lumbar where I previously had Nerve blocks. The middle and the base of the neck where it attaches to the brain stem. Per my Chiropractor's X-rays.      Got a concussion Sept 2015 the right side of my face went numb. Went to NCH-ER.      Flew the first time since 1995 to attend my nieces funeral in Massachusetts and some family members were saying I was drunk; how dare I do that at someone's wake especially your nieces. Had an Ex sister in law bring me into a bedroom to yell at me, she was mean and belligerent towards me. I walked out.      My son was waiting in the car to drive me. Before I could make it to the car I Blacked out, fell on paved driveway (never once Blacked-out my entire life) I told my son it was pitch black out he sad ""Mom it was 3 o'clock"" in April bright with overcast.      Thought I broke my hip and broke my total knee replacement. Called my orthopedic Doctor BWH.       Went the next day for X-rays I was bruised an extremely sore.  My son and his Girlfriend had to help me into bed daily. Totally wrecked my Mother's Day with my son, who I see once a year. I had to wear compression thigh high stockings to help prevent blood clots. Being prone to blood clots my doctor said he didn't want me to fly back to Florida as it was too risky. I had no choice!! Still all on Credit Cards, just so I could be there for the funeral.  Severe Edema most days have to put feet up. I want to get well so I can go back to work and be productive and contribute to my family rather than having to use all the equity in our home in Massachusetts. Now after paying 27 years we didn't have enough for ten % down on a 200,000 villa. Having to get PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)   Insurance company refusing to pay, ate all our equity.       Now we have a 30 year mortgage because of my ill health over the last twenty years.       Some family members saying I was drunk at my nieces wake/funeral. They are completely unaware of how ill I really am. Every six months I come very close to death. I told them but no one listens, truly Hears what your saying. Alcohol intolerance one small glass of wine I'd throw it up.  I have Vertigo, very topsy turvy and easily tip in either direction, Severe headaches and feel like I have the Flu 24/7,  365 and random falls from Blackouts.      The added stress to a stressful funeral is why I blacked out (Vagas Nerve causes black outs when under severe stress) compromised nervous system and being a ""Sensitive body"" My eyes cross. Blurred vision, double and random triple vision, losing eyesight rapidly. Several months ago I was 20/80 in late Feb. (2016)  20/60.  I'm also going blind.      I need money to get alternative treatments of IV Ozone therapy $ 150.00 each.  I go to an out of network Chiropractor called Trinity chiropractic Dr. Joel Boeheimer. He truly wants to help me get to the root of the problem. My first Chiro appointment they X-ray your spine. My curve in the back of my neck should be at a 45 degree angle I measured a -2 (47 degrees in the wrong direction.)    I cashed in my only IRA for the few IV Ozone treatments I can get, then the money is gone.     I have a placard until 2019 and after that they said they'd give me my permanent one.           I have no savings. I have a ring on consignment at Provident Jewelers Downtown Naples, which hasn't sold yet.         My husband works hard labor 6 days a week to help with bills our insurance won't pay.      Years ago, they would give me all the pain pills I want ""for life"".  After a month or so on fentanyl 100 mg patches switched every third day, OxyContin around the clock with Percocet for breakthrough pain. Doctor's said I can have this for Life. That was no life and never helped. I was still in debilitating pain all over my body.        I went right to Holistic remedies and Organics, Non GMO foods and drink mostly R.O. water or  green (Veggie) drink I make myself.       I'm Gluten free since 2011. Sugar free as well. I have done everything I've suppose to do but yet they can't pinpoint it.         I've been told I have MS, Parkinson's and most recently it's a ""Neurological Degenerative Disease"" on top of the rest of my diagnose's.      I have nothing left to Sell Consign or Cash in. Please help me only if you can.   I have never ask anyone for help money or otherwise, my entire life.    I'm in a serious situation. I would really like to be alive to see my son get married one day. Maybe a grandchild or not. But I'm not done living. This is hell on Earth.   It's truly debilitating. When you push yourself, you pay for days, even weeks just going out to dinner. Something no one deserves. I'm slowly getting eaten from the inside out, from Fungus, yeast overgrowth, viruses and God only knows what else. https://www.holtorfmed.com/ozone/",https://images.gofundme.com/HhrcF7oYbfg9cs46JhM5MEGnqBc=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17209298_1488080802.2724.jpg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Alisa McDonough is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$9,840 raised of $20,000 goal"

Many family members and friends afar are asking how they can help when they are not in a position of being present, and therefore the idea of a ""Fund Me"" page was created.  If you know John or Shelley...... well, you will know that it is very difficult for either of them to accept help or assistance because they are more concerned with helping others!Our main thought behind the page is to help assist them financially while Shelley can be with John during his fight.  They shouldnt have to worry about anything else during this time. Lets surround them with the love and support that so many close and far have received from them. This is being sent out to those that have been touched by both their spirts, love, friendship and dedication to helping others, so please lets rally together and help them!",https://images.gofundme.com/TE-yHJJZqWiUuRd3qYZ_UF3mAHY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17209390_1483593466.454.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Tiffany Pecush Whitfield is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,530 raised of $5,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/ramon-and-navarros-lifeline,Ramon and Navarro's Lifeline,"UPDATE: I AM BACK TO ASK FOR HELP FOR NAVARRO. He is in need of surgery to remove a painful anal gland tumor. He has been through a round of antibiotics to clear up the infection and the next step is the removal of the growth and biopsy. Even though we have a veterinarian that is giving him a discount, Ramon is on a fixed income and the costs are just too much for him. Right now we need $1500 to get the surgery done ASAP, then probably another $1500 for after care such as meds and doctor visits. It is possible that this growth is cancer, however, we are not addressing that until a biopsy is done. If you are able to help and want to send money directly to Ramon, please ask me privately for his address. This is a faster, easier way for him to receive donations without fees being taken out. From last year... For the friends of Ramon Johnson, I ask for your help once again. As you know, our community was able to help Ramon and Navarro while they were homeless last year. We were able to raise money to get them a motel room now and then to clean up and get some sleep. Ramon has since been living in a studio apartment in San Jose that allows him to keep his beloved therapy dog, Navarro. Ramon needs our help to maintain this living situation and keep from losing his belongings that are still in storage. He and Navarro both need medical care that he can't afford on his very limited income. Can we rally together again to help him out?

Anna will need to be off work for up to 6 weeks after her surgery and will have a follow up surgery sometime in the fall. Due to being on maternity leave after giving birth to Sam last year, she does not have enough sick leave to cover all of the recovery time needed. In addition, while she has insurance, she still has some out of pocket medical expenses and deductibles that need to be paid.For those of you who know Anna and her husband Jesse, you know that they have two young sons, Sam, (11 mos.), and William (4 1/2), and a teenage son Trentin. Those of you in the Flathead area of Northwest Montana know that her and Jesse have been part of the Columbia Falls and Whitefish communities for a very long time. For those of you who don't know Anna, she is a caring, optimistic soul who always gives others so much of her time and kindness. She is one of my best friends, and there are a lot of other people who say that about her, because it's true. Since I can't wave a wand and make this stupid, ridiculous disease go away, I wanted to do something that can at least relieve some of the financial burden and stress while her and Jesse focus on Anna's healing and caring for their boys.The fundraising goal will help cover Anna's out of pocket medical expenses and will make up for lost pay while she is out of work.

She managed to pay outright for her plot, headstone and opening and closing. She set up through a company named Hobbs-Js Williams an arrangement for her casket, embalming, transfer of remains, death certificate, grooming and dressing, family car and escorts etc. This company went out of business YEARS ago, leaving my granny with zero. It is heartbreaking to know that she died believing that she had everything in order w/ receipts to confirm and now benefit from nothing that she paid for. I had been her only caretaker in which she lived with me and passed in my home. I am not financially able to pay for my Granny to have the funeral that she desired.

Unfortunately, most  of the elders we interviewed are now deceased. As a result, these tape recordings are priceless treasures of history. Normal shelf life of cassettes is 10-15 years. Some of these cassette tapes are 29 years old! They are fragile, and have far exceeded the normal life span of analog magnetic tape; they may have only one playing left. We desperately need to get these cassettes digitized, transcribed, archived and copied for the Nez Perce Tribe or they will be lost. Once the Nez Perce recordings are preserved, then we will work to preserve the oral histories of the other Tribes in our Archive -- Kalispel, Coeur d'Alene, Kootenai, Shoshone-Bannock and Shoshone-Paiute -- as well as the Swinomish Tribal Community and Spokane Tribe in Washington state.

Ein Langdistanz-Triathlon ist das, was viele von euch als ""Ironman"" kennen und besteht aus:3,8km Schwimmen180km Fahrrad42,195km LaufenDamit unser Leiden nicht ganz umsonst ist (von Ruhm und Ehre mal abgesehen), haben wir uns entschlossen, dass wir für das Projekt SThree Challenge Roth 2017 Spenden sammeln. Nach langer Überlegung haben wir uns entschlossen, die Erlöse des Spendenaufrufs an den Verein „Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder Frankfurt e.V. “. Hierbei handelt es sich um einen Verein, der 1983 von Eltern, deren krebskranke Kinder an der Kinderklinik des Universitätsklinikums Frankfurt behandelt wurden, gegründet wurde und unbürokratisch Unterstützung und Begleitung für die erkrankten Kinder, Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen und für deren Geschwister, Eltern und sonstigen Angehörigen bietet. Genaueres zu dem Verein und wie ihr spenden könnt, findet ihr unter Spenden.Die Challenge Roth bzw. „DATEV Challenge Roth“(bis 2009 „Quelle Challenge Roth“) ist seit 2002 der Name des weltweit größten Wettkampfs auf der Triathlon-Langdistanz im mittelfränkischen Roth. Mit 3.400 Einzelstartern und 1.950 Staffelteilnehmern aus über 60 Nationen sowie laut Angaben der Polizei 260.000 Zuschauern an der Strecke wurde die Veranstaltung von 2011 an sechsmal in Folge als Deutschlands „Rennen des Jahres“ geehrt. Der Triathlon über 3,8 km Schwimmen, 180 km Radfahren und einem Marathonlauf über 42,2 km zählt zu den traditionsreichsten und bestbesetzten europäischen Veranstaltungen über diese Distanz und gehörte als erster Wettkampf zur Challenge Family Weltserie.Natürlich kann jeder für diesen guten Zweck spenden. Als Mitarbeiter der SThree GmbH habt ihr jedoch den Vorteil, dass ihr auf uns ""wetten"" könnt. Da es das ultimate Battle zwischen Sales (Volker) und Support Services (Niklas) gibt, wird am Ende ein Sieger feststehen. Bei eurer Spende müsst ihr einfach euren Namen mit dem Hinweis ""SThree"" angeben, so dass wir wissen, dass ihr Mitarbeiter der SThree GmbH seid, sowie dem Namen, den ihr als Sieger tippt (""Niklas"" oder ""Volker""). Mit jeder Spende á €10 nehmt ihr an einer an den Wettkampf anschließenden Verlosung Teil. Habt ihr richtig getippt und auf beispielsweise Niklas gesetzt und er gewinnt gegen Volker, kommt euer Name jeweils ein Mal pro €10 in den Verlosungstopf. Wenn ihr also €50 spendet, habt ihr 5 Chancen gezogen zu werden. Eure ""Wette"" könnt ihr zwischendurch auch noch ändern. Ihr habt zum Beispiel auf Volker gewettet und stellt nun fest, dass Niklas doch deutlich besser ist und mehr trainiert. Dann könnt ihr euren Einsatz wechseln! Hierfür spendet ihr dann nochmal eine Wechselgebühr von €5 und gebt an, dass ihr ""Wechsel auf Niklas"". Euer ursprünglicher Wetteinsatz ist damit auf Niklas geändert.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-young-women-in-nairobi,Kenya young Women's rescue centre,"Hello I'm  Tara, I am a  senior specialist Psychotherapist trained in working with Trauma alongside Anxiety and Depression. I help to empower people to reclaim their life. All of my career has been dedicated in the UK and I recently have taken 7 months to see different areas of the world. I have seen how other areas desperately need assistance especially from trained individuals to help start off programmes and allow local people run their own centres. This need has seen me decide to use my second half of my career break on volunteering.  The young woman's rescue centre in Kenya, Nairobi . The programme works with 25 females aged 12-24. These children and young women have endured abuse in different variations, sexual assault, sent to work too young and/or homeless. This environment is the young women's chance to feel safe, to have space where they can experience others with similar stories and learn skills to rebuild. They also will receive psychological input and this is where I would come in.  Alongside assisting the girls with daily activities to build a relationship I would also offer 1:1 psychotherapy sessions allowing each individual the space and time to start a healing process. Alongside I will also develop sustainable group psychotherapy sessions looking at building their ability to develop compassion for themselves and reduce suffering.   I will be unpaid but receive hostel accommodation and some meals free for my time. I am offering 3 months with a possibility to extend as a shorter time will be unsettling for the young women in therapy alongside this allows the locals in the centre time to adjust to any new groups and be confident in continuing them.  Now to where you guys can see if you can help! The programme is not inexpensive. I will work unpaid but need to cover the registration fee for the nonprofit voluntary organisation alongside other costs.  (www.lovevolunteers.org/programs/volunteer-Kenya/pricing)  Pricing list for Kenya ‌  Lowdown on costs Registration fee to volunteer:£205  12 week programme:  £822 (This covers the accommodation majority of food and transport one way from the airport). Visa  to enter Kenya: £50 Nomads travellers insurance: £180 Flights (checked Jan 17): £500 Extra daily living costs for 12 weeks : £1000 this is to cover extras transport, food for meals that are not included.   Costs I will personally cover It is reccomended by the Love Volunteer organisation to have £25 a day. This amounts to £2100. I will fund £1100. I will also fund vaccinations needed to enter Kenya.  Any money donated will go towards helping me reach the centre and will not be funding anything that is not DIRECTLY aimed at helping these vulnerable individuals.  The money is needed as soon as possible. This will allow me to secure a place as soon as I can and let the organisation and community know I am coming to support them.  How you are involved   I know there are many of you that want to help but simply cannot commit this amount of time.  By offering any sum you are part of this. You will be helping others who have been worst affected by social injustice giving hope to rebuild their future. Seeing that we can change an individuals story and create a different ending. I will help you feel involved by emailing/posting photos of what is happening including blog like updates...you will be with me!  I personally would feel privileged to work with such a community alongside survivors of trauma. I would be eternally grateful for any of your support in helping me go towards reducing suffering in these children and young women.",https://images.gofundme.com/wFE8hm4-kjcd0S_2Pag1XNM8KfY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17211094_1484021590.7401.jpg,[],0,"Created January 9, 2017",Tara O'Donoghue is organizing this fundraiser.,Volunteer & Service,"£2,820 raised of £2,810 goal"

Though she puts a brave face on it, she knows all too well that lying in bed all day stops being fun when you don't have any choice. Unfortunately our house was not built for people with disabilities, so she can't even get out of the bedroom without a lot of help from me, and every time we do that her pain fatigue and multiple other symptoms increase for a fortnight. It  has been very difficult for friends to visit, so she gets lonely when I am at work. She has barely seen outside the house for years, but perhaps worst of all she has not been able to have a shower, something we take for granted.Recently we borrowed as much as we could from the bank and are getting an extension done to the house. This will incorporate a new bathroom, big enough for a special shower bed in which she can be moved from the bedroom to the bathroom and back again for a shower. The extension will have special wide doors throughout so that I can wheel her in her bed out onto the verandah sometimes if it is a nice day. The cafe blinds - ziptrak type is what we were looking at for outside on the verandah area. These have a blockout feature which means that Erin can go outside but still have the light blocked out so she doesnt get migraines from the light. Erin is extremely light sensitive which is why she needs day blinds which have partial blockout as well as full blockout blinds for the night time - just in our bedroom and the guest bedroom. Our bedroom will be joined to another room so that people will be able to come to dinner without having to cram into the bedroom.Also we have a new guest bedroom which will double as a second lounge room because the current lounge room is not accessible for Erin in the bed. This means that when friends come over Erin can see them in the new lounge room and interstate family can have somewhere to stay when they visit us. We needed to replace exisiting carpet in bedroom end of the house to tiles as due to multiple chemical sensitivity this is the only thing Erin was not allergic to as the carpet was about 40 years old! Also the shower bed cannot be moved on carpet and carpet cant get wet so really there was no option but to replace the carpet. Also the rooms havent been painted since about 1990 and we are having to use clay based paint because Erin is allergic to acrylic paint as a consequence of having the rooms tiled and painted we are having to move everything out for about a month to get it done - this also allows time for the smells to start to disappear. Because Erin needs to be in  a hospital bed she cant just camp on the couch or floor however that is what I will be doing! Erin needs to go to respite accommodation for this time that is why we are asking for help to pay for this - as it is only partially funded by the government and without going to respite the renovation cannot be finished.So far so good. Unfortunately, the amount we were able to borrow did not cover all that we need. We are asking for money to help pay for these things and anything else that pops up:Blinds Cafe curtains - ziptrak blinds for new verandah areaSofa bedBuilt in WardrobeRoller doorConcertina door to divide our bedroom from the bedroom next doorHelp to cover some of the respite accommodation costssmall generatorThe renovation is now in full swing and we really need the money as soon as possible while somethings are not as urgent as others respite is happening from the end of january for a month so this will need to be paid for within a couple of months.Please contribute to our campaign.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/youngwomensgrouplib,Young Women's Group - Liberia,"What this is.A Liberian-based, Liberian-managed, after-school, youth-centered, young women’s empowerment program. Why this is needed.Liberian girls have high dropout rates, largely due to teenage pregnancy, early marriage, and detrimental traditional practices.  63% of Liberian girls between the ages of 15 and 24 are illiterate - to put it another way, there is a greater chance of a Liberian girl being married before the age of 18 than there is of her being able to read. An astounding 63% of primary-aged girls are out of school, and even when girls graduate, they do so only half as literate as their male counterparts.*As you can see, the need for change within the Education system, especially pertaining to young women, is astonishing. *Front Page African, June 2016. Click here for the full article.What we will do.We will start a Young Women’s Group at a school in Liberia.  The program will engage the young women in various discussions and workshops, focusing on empowerment, development, leadership, and activism, through a carefully curated set of workshops. The workshops themselves will cover a variety of important skills, such as: vision boarding, goal setting, community project planning, and presentation skills. Additionally, the program will provide them with the knowledge and confidence to set up and maintain their own Young Women’s Group, furthering the reach of the program’s impact.  By “paying it forward,” the young women will uplift each other and their communities. Where your money goes.The cost to put one young woman through the entire program is $150. Therefore, a donation of $150 will effectively sponsor a participant.  As recognition of your generosity, every full sponsorship will receive a personal thank you note, as well as a first-hand account and reflection of the program.Donations will cover operational costs such as food, transportation, materials, mentors, and lodging. The cost for the two-week program, plus the three-day weekend retreat, will be an estimated amount of $3,800/ $150 per young woman. Any extra funds raised will be used to directly expand the program’s reach. Why this is so important.Every day I see first-hand the dire need for youth development and empowerment programs.  As the statistics show, this need is especially true for young women. It’s incredibly sad what a young woman has to go through just to get basic education here in Liberia and in many other nations around the world, especially given how influential such women can, and should, be in their society. This project is a stepping stone for young women in Liberia to get the support they so desperately need. I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in the middle of the civil war.  Thankfully, and by God's grace, my family escaped and ended up in a refugee camp for a few months before heading to England. After several years, we relocated to the U.S.  It was in Southern California where I pursued my degrees in Education. I knew very early on that I wanted to be a teacher.  I enjoyed asking questions and learning new information. But the main reason I enjoy teaching is actually being a part of that young person’s personal development.  It was always my dream to return home. I recently fulfilled this dream and moved back to Liberia to work within the Education field.  Now I am back here I am finally able to act upon my passion for empowering young women through education. As the program develops, I intend to continue to build after-school, youth-centered empowerment programs, just like this, across Liberia. This initial phase of the program will be used as a launchpad for encouraging change across the country.THANK YOU for taking the time to read this. Whether or not you donate, I appreciate you acknowledging it.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/bob-grappone-medical-expenses,Bob Grappone Medical Expenses,"Bob Grappone had just recently retired from the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Department. His wife Ginger and him began to do a little of that long awaited travel that most people dream of for when they retire. They had been on vacation with Christy and her family on Thanksgiving week and he was just fine and on Sunday November 27, after falling 6 times in 2 days he was admitted to the hospital. Unfortunately for them Bob contracted a very rare full body paralyzing disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome.Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure. The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There are a number of subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy. In those with severe weakness, prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin’s or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, will lead to good recovery in the majority. Recovery may take weeks to years. About a third have some permanent weakness. Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at one or two cases per 100,000 people every year. In just over 30 days Bob has lost 60 lbs. and although out of intensive care he will be in recovery and rehabilitation for a very long time. The toll emotionally and financially has devastated them both. There are many things that insurance will not cover such as long term care, travel, hotels, meals and many other hidden cost. Ginger has used up all her vacation and sick leave and has gone back to work to help meet their needs, but they need the help of others who are willing to come to their aid in this time of need. Please do what you can to help and share this request with as many other people as you can so we all can make a difference in Bob and Gingers lifes.As their friend I am asking for you help and support.

A Parent of quality is not threatened by a Parent seeking EqualityANYTHING helps. PROOF in updates :)  My name is Destiny; I'm Mom to 5 amazing kiddos.  Wife to an amazing husband.   I'm asking for your help to ERASE the space that has been left in our family, our hearts, and our souls.  This page has been debated, however after much family and friend support, here we are. Page made and a mission to help raise funds for our case to be heard in Appeals court.   My family is on a mission to raise around $20k to cover legal fees with our custody case.  Yep - all this is going to my attorney. No kidding.  I will be more than happy to show statements and payments, I've got nothing to hide with showing where anyones help is going..Someone asked what this means GoFundMe page means to me? It's not just me, it's us.  I have been in and out of court since June 2014.  WE agreed that year for kids to be with me 4 days a week, father 3, I get the kids off the bus every day, snow days, summers, kids stay with me while he works.  That was a great day, we received kudos from the bench for thinking about our kids! I work a school schedule and while together, that was our goal; get me working on the kid’s schedule.  GOAL complete.  Yes, even then - I continued to see my children and them be raised with their siblings EVERY DAY. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  It worked, we were cool.  Kids were happy and thrived.  We lived practically in the same neighborhood, it was chill and good times. Mind you this wasn't every day hanging out,  he'd have me over to cook for the kids or watch them if he would be gone, we'd go to drive-in's together, went Trick or Treating with the kids, I cooked Thanksgiving, did our Black Friday shopping, I mean we would all hang out time to time, and life was pretty smooth.  GO US - right? Seems no issue if we're picking out his new bedding, he's helping me move in my place, hooking up my dryer, I'm picking out his Christmas tree and doing his Christmas shopping with his debit card, right?   I truly believe in all my heart this shift happened March 2015.   I got engaged, filed for child support, and then got married.  The fallout since hasn't really stopped.  It's always something, usually covertly being done.Now it's 2017 and here's the current schedule.  As of December 7, 2016  our children have been split.  SPLIT.   I presently have sole custody of our daughter, and their father has sole custody of our boys.  Heartbroken isn't the word.  My kids are devastated, our family is torn, and even worse - when the boys are gone, no one can reach them.  We are  alienated from them.  The grandparents that they saw regularly, get nothing.  We have 4 days a month.  Being together all their lives, to 50/50 until 12/2016 is nothing short of gut wrenching.  It's not what we're used to at all, it's not any form of life that we've ever known.  365 days to 180 days a year, to 62 days a year.  303 days ERASED.  Professionals are floored. Family and friends speechless, and we're numb.  Our children don't want to be separated, they're all they've known.  These 5, they are it. It's them.  Each other. The 5th is the youngest at 1 - my husband and I had a daughter in 2015 and the other 4 are over the moon for her, especially Joshua.  Even she is different when her brothers aren't home.  Not to mention that my husband is the family favorite, each child we have adores him.  Joshua would talk to him everyday on his drive home from work (was 84 miles one way),  from superheroes, sports, drawing, laser tag, board games, you name it - he's there right by our sides.  The relationships are AWESOME, and no one has been able to refute that. EVER.  My soul aches, and hurts - no one should have to endure this - but so do theirs.   WE always said 50/50 over the years, for we split up many times over our 12 years together.   I blame myself, I should have left sooner, so many signs were there and I stayed to try to save my family.  I loaded my car and my kids many days, to be coerced to come back.  I wanted the family and I wanted to try.  I come from a divorced home myself and didn't want that for my kids.  Kids need their parents and siblings.  I was naive, I was weak, I was told I was worthless and would never make it.  Yes, I'm aware now we were victims of domestic violence.  They have an abuse chart - did you know that? (See photo.) However we're still being victimized.   I would have never believed in a million years so many events that have happened would have been possible.. Infinite Campus no longer reflects my boys, they're gone.  After years of being actively linked, on the PTA, involved, at IEP meetings, class basketball games, regular monthly visits to each lunch with the kids, ERASED.  I don't exist.  We don't exist. Our family doesn't exist.  I have been ""ended dated"" from the school.  All the years of Grandparent's lunches,  field trips, festivals, donations to classrooms, hours spent.  GONE.  ERASED.   My children are not in any school programs any longer, or any sports unless my ex controls it.  Originally had it ordered they go to a FREE learning program afterschool M-Th.  That is now refused to be used, for the boys began getting in trouble and it was documented, which was used in court.  One of the boys had been suspended from school, then suspended from the YMCA on two occasions for fighting, and all this only happens while they are gone.  AGGRAVATED is an understatement.  I don't understand.  We don't understand. Our family is falling through cracks due to the length of time and segments of being in court. Being left home alone,  unknown babysitters, no documentation of behavior, no school records, medical, communication, nothing...ghost.  Every day is a day to wonder where, what, how they are, are they safe, are they okay, and a count down to see their face.  Baffling that this is allowed isn't it?  Look at your child and imagine not seeing them for 14 days at a time, and knowing NOTHING or having no communication, period.  Sickening huh?  Like I said, wouldn't wish on anyone, it's deplorable. So the kicker and straw that has broken us to create this account?   Yesterday showed how far one will go and has gone to remove parents.  Good loving parents, who've been there, carried and delivered the child and has done nothing but advocate and try to take the high road.     The last order notes for my ex to still have access to medical and school records for our daughter.  No mention of this for me with the boys. He has run with this.  We're erased.  No communication, nothing.  Excuse used?  The DVO I have against him as reason why the kids can't call or Facetime us (including their brothers and sisters) when they're with him, they can't text either...but he and others Facetime, email, or text and has access when they're here - see the abuse wheel.   I'm not evil, and believe kids should have access to their parents.  I want peace, not torment.  I want nothing more than my children to have love and a childhood they don't have to recover from as adults. I want time, love, moments, and the opportunity to be the parent I've always been, that my husband and I have been.  I know, many of you are probably wondering - woman don't you want to contest custody?  I am and it's been filed - I'm getting there.  When we received the devastating news that my children were split, everything changed.  14 days before Christmas and my husband and I were rethinking every thing in our life.  I was out of work for a week, for devastated isn't the word...  My children have all been raised together. These 5 babies are IT.  They are the only siblings they each have and know.   I've  nursed all 5, cleaned vomit, stayed home, , played, dabbed, taken to surgeries, picked out cast colors, tooth extractions, shots, family game nights, homework, anything and everything  a mother does - raised, seen them or communicated in some capacity daily, and to be turned into an every other weekend parent?  We now live less than 4 miles away, same town.  I sat for 2 days going line for line why I disagreed with certain issues, many for they were lies that were gas lighted to the courts.  I've spent at least 80 hours in court over this, just in 2016 alone.  Not the type of frequent flyer status I want to have.  It is nuts.  NUTS.  Ya'll would fall over if you read some of these motions and issues, seriously, I had to go to court last year just to take my kids to Disney to watch their sister compete at UCA Nationals.  He would not agree and stormed out when it was ordered in favor of the children going.  Not 12 hours later I get a call that my home was broken into, after we'd left for Florida.    That isn't the worst, and when I say Lifetime movie, writers would use our life story as a template.  And that's not a good thing, it's embarrassing.  This is ALL embarassing and unnecessary. We're hopeful. We are asking for parallel parenting, but realistic to know that we're preparing for Appeals court.  Parallel parenting is a newer concept that hasn't made it to Kentucky yet, however has been shown to work in other states where high conflict exists.  Parents disengage and still have 50/50 with their children and communicate via an online program monitored by attorney's - keeping kids out of it.  A parent's dislike for the other, doesn't mean that either can't parent.  What do I want?  TIME.  I just want my boys time. MY CHILDRENS time.  To be Mom, the Mom they've had since I first heard their heartbeat and felt their kicks, the one that took them for their first haircuts, kisses boo boos, let's them get dirty, obliges in their requests to play HORSE, to just be and live.  To be able to text them and get a response that they know that I love them, their family loves them, to hear their giggles and have more Family Nights, to have more sleepovers in the floors, to have more days where my kids and their stepfather completely nerd out of Marvel and DC.  I LOVE IT.  It's been my life, it's been their entire life, all they've known, we've known, and what I was made for.  To be Mom.   The small moments to the big moments, seeing their faces when I took them to the ocean the first time, B meeting Spiderman, the boys meeting Jason David Frank (aka Green Ranger), how they light up when they see their sister and it goes back to the hugs, the giggles, and sneaking in my bed.  Taking care of them when they're sick and hearing just the word ""Mommy""...melts me every time.Everyday I send an email to them, to an account I made for them back in 2014.  One day they may understand and can make up their own mind, but until then we have to be their voice.  I pray daily, dozens of times - God is probably exhausted with me, but it's the most calming thing for me.  Even now that I write this, I wonder how their snow day is going, and wish they were with us snuggled up.  We always had snow days together filled with hot chocolate, movies, wet clothes, snow angels, and whatever snow challenge was trending.    Know we miss you guys so much and I'm so sorry this is happening.  It destroys me that we've seen each other less in the past year than ever in your life, but we won't stop.  Any help would be appreciated to save our family and fight the injustice that has been given.  I'm not a spiteful person and many have said I should have full custody, while I don't disagree, the fact remains my boys WANT to see BOTH parents and I would never deny them that.  WE want our family whole, we don't want to be erased.  This is bigger than our home, this impacts our huge family and close friends.  We aren't four days a month or 62 days a year, we're life, it's been life - all whom they've been imbedded heavily throughout life.  Your help to APPEAL this is appreciated beyond measure.  I love you boys, we're not giving up.  No matter how many times we get knocked down, or I've been knocked, down, even if 100 times, I've gotten back up 101.   www.facebook.com/dtsawyers  ￼",https://images.gofundme.com/W5KaY2OMkItENJiwdWCdfV4KFGE=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17212736_1483632278.7898.jpg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Destiny Sawyers Watson is organizing this fundraiser.,"Babies, Kids & Family","$1,975 raised of $20,000 goal"

After months passing and the police having no news of its location, she gave up hope it would be recovered and that it was most likely scrapped for parts. In January 2017 she received a letter in the mail the police have recovered her bike and is located at a tow yard. She now had some hope that she would be getting her bike back with minimal to no damage. When she arrived to the tow yard her bike was scrapped for parts and not worth her paying the $500 the tow yard was asking to get it back. Photos posted below will show her bike in its original condition and after photos when the police recovered it found on the street almost 3 months later.I have started this fund rasier for Crystal so her family, friends and anyone who would like to donate can help her with her loss. Her bike purchased used back in 2011 was over $3500 with modifications. Her bike was not fully insuranced and was not covered if it was stolen. We are only asking for the depreciated price of the bike and the funds she invested over time to modify it. Thank you so much for your time taking to read her story and for your donations. Any little bit helps and is greatly appreciated by Crystal, her family and friends. She will use her donations towards purchasing a new bike for herself <3Please share this post and help us spread the word to help get her some donations.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ccsvi-treatment-is-required,CCSVI Treatment Is Required,"My Story:I was diagnosed with MS after a decade of having a misdiagnosis of a benign brain tumor on March 4, 1997. the day after my 32nd birthday.  I had 10 years of normal, healthy and active living, but I started having major issues in  2004, so I went back to my doctor thinking it was growing and maybe it was time I had brain surgery to remove it.  Finally, after many doctor visits about my mounting symptoms, my doctor arranged for me to have a MRI in 2008, which told me the truth.In 2010, I was one of the first 500 - 1,000 people in the world to have a treatment to open my veins to allow for my blood to drain from my brain to go back to my heart to be re-oxygenated after W5 presented it on November 21, 2009 about Dr. Paolo Zamboni and his discovery.  Since then, doctors from many parts of the world (except Canada) have made great strides to perfect the procedure to be better and longer lasting. That treatment gave me a little more than 6 years of a full life that I definitely wouldn't have had without it.___________________________________________________________If you prefer, you can contribute to my Paypal account at dianagordonbarrie@gmail.com instead, or e-transfer (to the same e-mail address) because Gofundme takes a % off the top, and Paypal & e-transferring doesn't.   I also have a bitcoin wallet:  1GrrSkUpn3nMGQEtYfPgrs51sK74PoqgJZand please send me an e-mail at dianagordonbarrie@gmail.com so I know who to thank.  :)___________________________________________________________I had the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) treatment to correct my vein issues in April of 2010 performed by the wonderful Dr. Gary Sisken (Interventional Radiologist) in Latham, NY.  I was awake throughout the entire procedure.   This issue is the cause of MS, at least in my case, and it makes perfect sense.CCSVI  causes hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood because it can't circulate back to the heart to re-oxygenate) which causes MS because hypoxia kills brain cells. CCSVI = Hypoxia = MS  It's just that simple.I am a Canadian, so everything was completely out of pocket, and was VERY expensive.  I can't afford to do that again, so I want to have my veins fixed in a way that this is my second (and last) time I will ever have to have it done.They won't treat me anywhere in Canada because I have the unfortunate diagnosis of MS and the Neurologists here think they own the disorder, so they control the people with it (because of the lucrative kickbacks from Big Pharma).  Neurologists run the MS Societies and the government listens to them and do what they recommend, so in fact, we are screwed here.  I used to weight train, run, bike and play competitive sports, but now I can barely walk and I get overwhelmed easily;  I want to be active again and have fun with my life.It would be fantastic to be treated in my own backyard at my local hospital (with no hospital stay), but alas, they won't allow it to be done here.  It is a very political topic in Canada, with us left suffering because of the sqabbling by the people who think they own our lives.  Sadly, I am caught in the cross-fire. Neurologists use the arguement that it is not proven and is therefore unsafe for us to have this procedure, even though there so many very qualified and skilled Interventional Radiologists ready to perform this procedure here in Canada.  Really, when you think of it, how safe do you think having MS is?  People are dying every day from it, or are getting more and more disabled and cause further drain and strain on our tax dollars.  It boggles my mind that they would rather load us up with toxins from daily injections and pills (Big Pharma again), than to treat us simply, quickly and inexpensively (if we could be treated where we live).The procedure I had consisted of simple balloon angioplasty and took about an hour to perform including the ballooning of both jugular veins and the insertion of 6 centimetre stent in my azygous vein; and 3 hours sitting up in the recovery room ; my azygous vein  was not only narrowed (stenosed), but it was also twisted, so it required the stent to keep it open; Dr. Siskin decided I didn't require stents in my jugular veins because they looked open and stable after being ballooned,CSVI is real, (and treatable),and mine as well as many others' improvements for over 6 years prove that MS is a symptom of CCSVI and not a disease on its own (at least in my case). We have been made to become our own doctors since this all began, since many doctors refuse to admit that it helps us to regain the quality of life many others enjoy. Dr. Paolo Zamboni (from Italy) was the first to discover and treat this in Ferrara, Italy and found it gave mobility back to those he treated. Many of us are more knowlegeable about this than our GPs mainly because we have to be. I am the first to have informed mine when I asked him to refer me to have my first doppler ultra sound. I knew exactly what I needed and where to go for it.Facebook has a tremendous community for those of us who have had the treatment, for those who are waiting to have it, as well as for those (and their families) who are wanting to learn more about it, who want to improve the lives of MS sufferers and/or their loved ones. There is a Facebook page ""CCSVI in Multiple Sclerosis"", where there is a wealth of information about this, and Joan Beal, the page owner's husband Jeff, was the first person in North America to have this treatment.  Go to Facebook and go to the page and see the information about this.What Changed With MeThis past spring, I started experiencing muscle weakness in both of my arms and legs, which has gotten much worse in the following months.  In September,I was up north (French River, Ontario) for my nephew's wedding, when my legs (especially my left one) didn't want to work, so I fell several times at my parents home and during the service and reception because something as simple as the wind knocked me over, or someone walked by me quickly and startled me. I have fallen when I have to make a step up, no matter how high and have had the knees ripped out of almost all of my pants; it hurts to fall, and I don't want to fall anymore. I have difficulty walking with a cane, and can't coordinate myself with one.  My speech is becoming more and more garbled, as well as my eyesight is getting more and more blurry (moreso than just age-related).  I also have a difficult time typing and writing, as I did before my first treatment.Everything else seems to remain to be, at least for the time being.I am scared for the future that I will lose more of my abilities, and I just want my life back.Dr. Siskin doesn't provide this treatment anymore, for whatever reason, so did my homework and decided I want to go to Dr. Salvatore Sclafani in Brooklyn, NY (https://www.aacbrooklyn.com/doctor/salvatore-j-d-sclafani-md-fsir/  ), who has been one of the superstars of this procedure since it all began. He is doing IVUS (Intravascular ultrasound) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravascular_ultrasound ), where he takes a look at the inside of veins during the procedure to get a better idea about what is going on. I already have a 6 centemetre stent in my azygous vein (I call it my souvenir), and I will probably need one or more in my jugular veins, left illiac and renal veins, but he won't know for sure until during the procedure to ensure I won't need to have this procedure ever again, and let neuroplasticity (rewiring in my brain) to happen so I can do everything normally again.   This is an excerpt of the e-mail response Dr. Sclafani wrote back to me, ""evaluation of the left renal vein and the left iliac vein are important in patients with sensorimotor deficits"".  Yes, my fellow Canadians, American doctors are accessible by e-mail and they do respond, personally.  ;)In addition to having the procedure, I will need transportation costs to Brooklyn (my roommate has graciously offered to drive me down), accommodations for 2 nights, and whatever is prescribed for me, but I hope to find a natural-based pain killer for the stents I know I will have to have.I am only 52 years old and want to be mobile for when I have grandchildren. Again, I know exactly what I need done and exactly where I need to go to get it; I have done my homework.I am not scared about the procedure at all (including getting stents) because a lot of work has been done to understand what is going on, and they have made stents made specifically for veins.  I have met Dr. Sclafani at various events after my first procedure.  I am scared, however, if I don't have it; my future will be a bleak one, one that I don't want to even contemplate; I watched my biological father die from MS, and I don't want to die the way he did.I need your help.  Even if you can only afford a dollar or two, all combined, a little can grow into enough.  You will be helping to save my quality of life.  Please donate whatever you can, so I can have this procedure, because I know first hand, that it works and works well.Thank you!  Diana Gordon",https://images.gofundme.com/OeDRvPRN6kMSWj69OkG4jlAjtVY=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z_uU0B8IaoM/0.jpg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Diana Gordon is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,040 raised of $25,000 goal"

They adopted three older siblings: two boys - Johan and Pachito - and a girl, Daniela.  We adopted two children, Santiago and Juliana. Our two families have remained good friends ever since.Recently, the Davies have experienced physical and financial setbacks. In August 2016, Trish and to undergo surgery for hernia repair. Complications followed about a week later when her wound opened and the doctor made the decision to care for it with ""wet to dry"" dressings. During a dressing change, Mike and Trish realized something was terribly wrong. The would and surrounding tissue was not recognizable as human skin/tissue. After a call to the on-call surgeon, Trish was directed to the emergency room, where she was admitted. Emergency surgery was scheduled for the next day.  During this time, Trish was kind of in and out of it, but Mike was told that she had a very serious, antibiotic resistant infection called acinetobacter. After being admitted via the ER on Aug. 12, she needed six additional surgeries to keep the infection from reaching her bloodstream, which would have meant sepsis. After an additional 27 days in the hospital, she came home on Sept. 7. Trish was pretty much restricted to being in her recliner in the living room. The only exceptions were to use the bathroom, and an occasional, escorted, walk to the kitchen and back to help reduce the horrible swelling in all her extremities. Home care was set up to have a nurse visit 3 times per week to evaluate and change dressings. Also for 5 weeks after being discharged in September, she was on home IV therapy to continue to battle the infection. An additional trip had to be made to the ER due to possibility of infection in PICC line used for home IV. Thankfully, there was no infection.Trish continued getting care throughout October and December, with still some physical setbacks. Consequently, these issues are hindering her from returning to her full-time job. Her 12 weeks of FMLA expired in October, but thankfully, she was just recently approved for LongTerm Disability. Though Mike is working and has picked up a part time job, they are still down a significant salary to maintain their family of five. For the first time since they've owned their home, they have not been able to make two months of mortgage payments. They are also behind on several other bills as well, and haven't even begun to pay the medical bills they've received to date. Here's where we can help.  If you feel moved to support the Davies, any amount would be so appreciated.

She went through chemo and numerous rounds of radiation, along with a feeding tube to nourish her as she endured the brutal assault of the treatments. She was then declared cancer free for two years until recently until she got the news that it had returned. Her doctor is recommending a 10 hr surgery that will remove the cancer, but will result in having her jaw bone replaced with titanium, along with skin grafts taken from the back of her knee. This is a major surgery and will require a very long recovery period, with scheduled therapies to help her eat and talk again. Her surgery will be scheduled sometime this month and I will let you know when that is and her how her recovery is going. We are working to help raise money for Margie to help her and her family during this very difficult time. Funds raised will help with what insurance does not cover and everyday expenses. Every little bit helps and will be very appreciated. If you are unable to help monetarily, then prayers and positive thoughts are always appreciated.I've known Margie since 10th grade and we've been best friends ever since.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gq-send-a-student-to-secondary,Send a student to secondary!,"On the Road to Reaching their DreamsIn 2009, Bridge International Academies began providing low-cost, high-quality pre-primary and primary education for children across Kenya whose families live on less than $2 per day. In 2015 and 2016, our first cohorts of Class 8 pupils graduated.These kids soared on the KCPE exam—the exit exam which all Kenyan children take before leaving primary school—distinguishing themselves among their peers at other public and private schools. In 2017, Bridge had 1, 693 graduates pass the KCPE and now aspire to attend secondary school. In 2017, 5 Bridge pupils scored above 400 on the KCPE—an accomplishment that only 5,000 pupils in the whole nation achieved. 26 Bridge pupils scored above 380, and more than 700 earned marks above 300! Not surprisingly, many hundreds of Bridge’s graduates have qualified to join fantastic secondary schools—both national and international. Unfortunately, even the most affordable secondary schools are often prohibitively expensive. That’s why we are starting this Go Fund Me campaign. None of the money will go to Bridge International Academies. Any money raised will be used by our graduates to fund their secondary school educations. In other words, it will help them take the next big step towards reaching their dreams!Meet a few Bridge graduates: Annecia Chepchirchir lives in Vihiga Serem, a small village in Kenya, with her mother, father, and four siblings. Even though she must walk a great distance to and from her Bridge academy each day, Annecia does so because education matters to her a great deal. “In my community,” she says, “many girls drop out of school. There is a lot of pressure where I come from for girls to get married very early.” Annecia has big dreams--she wants to become a surgeon—and she knows that education is key, but she can’t take secondary school for granted despite all her hard work, determination, and excellent KCPE results. Already, Annecia is a role model for other girls in her village. Given the right opportunities, there’s no telling what great things she’ll accomplish in the future, who she’ll inspire, or how she’ll change the world for the better! Harrison Charles lives in a small house just outside of Mombasa. “I was born here and have never been anywhere else,” he says. “One day, I would like to explore the world outside my small village.” Harrison knows that receiving an education is a good first step. While at Bridge, Harrison enjoyed all his classes—especially science, where his teacher guided pupils through lots of interesting experiments. As much as Harrison dreams of seeing the world, he loves Kenya and cares about the country’s future. “My greatest wish,” he says, “is to help end poverty in Kenya.” The world is a big place, but Harrison believes one person can have an impact. Given the right support and opportunities, there’s no telling how far Harrison Charles will travel from Mombasa, or what great things he’ll do when he returns home.",https://images.gofundme.com/22-BL2y0hWEp5QvnCKQHZeNOG14=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17213872_1483625418.7673.png,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Bridge International Academies is organizing this fundraiser.,Education & Learning,"$1,520 raised of $5,000 goal"

A life of suffering?  I know that anyone with a child knows the heartache of being helpless in knowing what to do to make your child better- I told Taylor that we can ask for help- she doesnt believe others would help her raise funds to afford these treatments- i told her she is wrong- please please please help me get help for my girl so she can live free of all of this; so i can see her shine with confidence again; so i can watch her dance like she used to; so she can pursue her beautiful singing career; so she can touch others with her warm heart and have the energy to give to others the way she does- her love fills a room, her smile is rare- when i get it- its all that matters.  OUR FAITH IN HUMANITY WILL BE CHANGED BY THIS EXPERIENCE- I NEED HER TO KNOW THE WORLD CARES!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/stemcellsforsuperman,Stem cells for superman,"Hi all! Our names are Jenna and Albert and were looking for some help for our superman.Lets start off with a backstory. Our dad was born without an esophagus, only being a couple hours old, they did a surgery where they took part of his large intestine and connected where he was missing the esophagus. Fast forward through a normal childhood. He married our mom and had us! Everything was normal for our family, we went camping and had fun. Our dad was so supportive of us growing up. Always attended our dance and karate competitions cheering us on the whole time. When we were 9 and 11, our dad had a massive heart attack. Watching him being taken away by an ambulance is something we will never forget. Since the first heart attack that required a triple bypass and months of recuperation, hes had two more heartattacks, a couple dozen times with pnuemonia, and a record of hospital stays that no 45 year old should ever have to endure. Because of the heart attacks and aspiration pnuemonies (along with different issues) his lungs and heart have been negatively affected. His heart is now permanetly damaged and funtions at 25-30%, while his lungs are working at 16%. His pulmonologist suggested a heart/lung transplant, but following up with his thoracic surgeon in Boston, we found out he was not able to have this as they would have to remove his esophagus also, a surgery that has never been performed. We were devastated by the news!!!  It appeared we had no more options.Days after we got the news, our dad was researching things to increase his lung capacity. He came across a stem cell therapy offered in Tampa, Fl. Its a 3-day treatment therapy that will take his own stem cells and rejuvinate them so that it will hopefully increase his lung function. We now have hope!!Heres the problem: it is (of course) not covered by any kind of insurance!! The procedure can cost over $10,000 along with the boosters a couple months after that are $4500 He would also need to get to Tampa for a 2 week stay which as you know, could get very expensive. This is something that is so important to our family, and to our dad who we all call superman.We know that times are tough for everyone, no donation is too small and we ask for prayers from all!!Thank you for taking your time to read this!! god bless :)Supermannoun su·per·man ˈsü-pər-ˌman  :  a person of extraordinary or superhuman power or achievements",https://images.gofundme.com/yo15exOMaDcsi0BP8YDbtXGJmGY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17214450_1485442844.0067.jpg,[],0,"Created January 26, 2017",Jenna Ouellette is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Janice Ouellette.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,167 raised of $20,000 goal"

I am well known in town and quite many police and EMTs showed up at my home and transported me to Hospital. I was on Life support for four days after waking up in ICU a week later not knowing what happened to me.10 days later I was discharged with what they did not know but they discharged me with the   C Diff Bug/Virus. From what I was told it is a life changer especially If it gets into your bloodstream there was not coming back. (that is what I was told at veteran’s hospital.Three days later I was rushed to veteran’s hospital and placed in ICU, I woke up three days later asking now wat happened.

He has been treated once in December 2016 with a chemo ebulization treatment that cost in the neighborhood of $20,000. He was able to pay for his deductible last year but because the treatments for the new year have already started it will be impoosibe to pay the out of pocket expenses again. The doctors tell him the only cure is transplant surgery and his treatment and care have been moved to Oregon Health Science University the liver transplant hospital in his area. The medical & travel costs for this year (2017) alone will far exceed the out of pocket deductible and once paid the treatments are paid for through his insurance. The treatments he will receive will hopefully see him through to the transplant stage.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/crishellecamp,Send Crishelle to Summer Camp!,"Hello friends! Most of you know that I have a little sister named Crishelle through the Big Brother Big Sister program. Crishelle and I connected 5 years ago and she's been a part of me and my family's life ever since. She was even a flower girl in my wedding (and tore up the dance floor)! She's now 12 years old and just completed 6th grade. Last year I started thinking about things for Crishelle to do during the summer. Unlike most kids we know, Crishelle actually dreads summer break because she's stuck at home with very little activity. In January of 2016 I started searching for summer camps and found Camp Lantern Creek, an all girls camp in Montgomery, TX that focuses on arts and fostering creative thinking and self-confidence in young women. Growing up going to camp every summer I thought back on how much it impacted my life for the positive and I wanted Crishelle to have the same experience as she had never been to any type of camp. So I applied for a scholarship and Crishelle was selected.Crishelle had no idea what to expect but was very excited (and a little nervous) when Jim and I dropped her off. When I picked her up a week later, she was like a different child. I didn't even recognize her. Mainly because her hair was so crazy! The photo above is a before and after of the day we dropped her off and the day we picked her up. HA! Crishelle left camp with a new energy and lots of life-long memories and has asked me about going to camp again every single weekend since. I reached out to the camp this year to inquire about applying for another scholarship and understandably, they have a policy to only provide scholarships once, to new campers. The camp is two weeks long and costs $2,400....which is steep, I know. So that's why I'm asking for your help to send Crishelle back to summer camp. She lives with her grandmother and 4 siblings and they do not have the means to help in any way.If you can, Crishelle and I will be forever grateful for any bit that you contribute. Attending camp not only gives her something to look forward to but will also make an impact on who she becomes as she nears her teenage years. Your generosity is greatly appreciated!Side note: If you have any interest in becoming a big brother or big sister, please let me know! It's an incredibly rewarding experience and they only ask that you  meet with your little 1-2 times per month.",https://images.gofundme.com/itSw-MvpjoA0Co4zlAY7rUDc-e0=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17214966_1483629410.7993.jpg,['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17214966_1483634691.6868_funddescription.jpg'],1,"Created January 5, 2017",Allison Bagley is organizing this fundraiser.,"Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$2,147 raised of $2,400 goal"

He was taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in ICU ever since. His blood pressure was up and his blood sugar was at 800 or 900 when they got him to the hospital. He was in a diabetic coma, I believe he is out of coma now. His blood sugar is down to 100 and something. He has a severe viral infection and the doctors have put him on an antibiotic. He has not opened his eyes yet. My parents have been up there with him non stop, and they are only letting 2 family memebers in at a time to see him every 4 hours. His kidneys are now failing and he is being transferred to another hospital. I am currently working in Antarctica and can not make it home to see him right now. He does not have any insurance and doesn't make enough to pay these bills at this time. He has been a fighter since before he was born. He was premature, only weighed 4 pounds and had his navel cord wrapped around his neck. He has dislexia, and developed diabeties at the age of 23. He enjoys working with and helping troubled teens.The money will be used to pay his medical bills and any other expenses incurred during this time. I'm not sure when we would need the funds, I think in the next 1-3 months.This means everything to me, he is my younger brother, we are 13 months apart.

When I lost Taylor a year and half ago, Kamal did EVERYTHING in his power to help me out. He started a GoFundMe for myself, along with other fundraisers and much emotional support. I want to do everything in my power to help his family and girlfriend out. Some of you may not know what happened, so to my best knowledge, I will briefly explain:Kamal was out New Year's Eve night with his girlfriend and friends. He had eaten a large dinner, and then stopped over at the Freehouse in Minneapolis to watch the ball drop. When I saw Kamal at this moment he was sober, and taking one for the team to be the DD that night. He was complaining about his acid reflux, but it didn't seem alarming. Shortly after he left the Freehouse they headed over to Legends...this is where it all went wrong. Kamal went to the bathroom by himself (only single stall bathrooms were here) and didn't return in the timely manner it would take to use the restroom. Allie and friends went to go check on him and couldn't get in the bathroom due to it being locked, and having no response from Kamal. They eventually got in and found Kamal unconscious and non responsive. They began to perform CPR immediately while they waited for the paramedics. Luckily the paramedics arrived within three minutes and revived him. They believe that Kamal may have been without oxygen for almost 10 minutes...this leading to the brain damage they found. They also found food particles in his lungs, leaving them pretty damaged along with some damage to his intestines. After Kamal had been admitted to HCMC for 24 hours, we thought he was making progress, but we were wrong. The doctors soon found that Kamal's heart wasn't repaired and beating on it's own as they thought it was, and his brain began to swell...leading us to loosing him. As we all know, Kamal was an AMAZING human. He was kind hearted and would do anything for the people he loved. His spirit filled the room, and there was never a dull moment when he was around. Kamal was loved by so many people, and has touched numerous hearts in many different ways. With Kamal leaving us all so suddenly, we find ourselves confused and saddened.

My name is Em Bryant, and I'm an instructor at Strongwater Farm.  I've been an instructor at Strongwater for almost two years, and every day I'm so thankful to be part of such an incredible non-profit. We have 12 amazing therapy horses that provide lessons to over 150 students each week. I'm running the Eastern States 20 Mile Race to raise money to support the care and well-being of Strongwater's horses. Being a therapy horse is an exceedingly difficult job - horses take on the physical, emotional, and mental load that a rider carries on every ride. Our horses are wonderfully patient and kind with every participant, and do their best to provide them with a safe, fun ride. The average age of one of our horses is around 20 years old, and all of our horses except two are over 15 years old - and our oldest is close to 30! These older horses (and our younger ones, too) have specific health needs that get more extensive as they age, and I'm looking to help ease some of those costs as we enter into the new year. No cost is too little or too great - $8 buys a bale of hay, $20 buys a bag of balanced, nutritional feed, $50 buys a container of much-needed joint supplement. For $100, you can sponsor a mile, and be featured on the official Running Strong for Strongwater Farm Donation Board, and receive a shout-out on our website and Facebook page!Please consider donating to Running Strong for Strongwater Farm to support our remarkable therapy horses.

She's a wonderful young womanHemispherectomy is a very rare surgical procedure in which one cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is removed, disconnected, or disabled. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy.[1] Hemispherectomy is reserved for the most extreme cases of this one-third in which the individual’s seizures are irresponsive to medications or other less invasive surgeries and significantly impair functioning or put the patient at risk of further complications. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85%-90% of patients. Additionally, it is also known to often markedly improve the cognitive functioning and development of the individual.Funding is needed prior to the July conference.

She managed to get her 10 yr old son, her little dog and her husband out of the house, but nothing else. They are not physically hurt, but they lost absolutely everything. All they have werethe pajamas they were wearing in 18 degree weather. The police think the fire was intentionally set and was meant to do them harm. They have to start over from the ground up. They did have a limited renters' insurance but it is not enough to even begin to rebuild their lives. They are living in a motel until they can try to find a new rental.

The Gallery evolved into a place for creative expression, from those performing or showing art for the first time to seasoned professionals, to express their hearts and souls, learn, teach and for the community at large to gather and enjoy their efforts.Two years ago we had to move from 500sq. feet and landed into nearly 6,000, at the proverbial location location location. The Gallery expanded quickly from a tiny room, barely able to contain itself, to a massive space that not only includes a wider variety of performance but also acts as a home for a number of micro businesses, artist spaces and vendors. Handmade African clothing and gifts, vintage records, vintage clothing and junktiques, Ethiopian coffee ceremonies, Solstice ceremonies, workshops..and more.The Gallery is an eclectic space that has been built on the experiences of the artists who work here and the people who support them. In the face of various challenges, both negative and positive, it continues to learn, grow and adapt to become a safer and even more inclusive space for all.Along with the much larger space came much larger bills and rent. Because the Gallery has generally operated in a way that favors creative expression more than business, it is not always on top of the basic expenses it takes to exist.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-alimartin-get-24-hour-care,Help Ali/Martin Get 24 hour Care,"This is a story of love that is unconditional, compassionate, and complete devotion for 40 years. Ali and Martin Casado have been married 40 years Although an unexpected courtship that resulted from a blind date, the connection and attraction was instantaneous…then came love. Martin, who had never been married and had no children, took on 3 kids from his new marriage with Ali, which wasn’t easy. This sweet man was everything Ali wanted in a man.Martin is a family man who gave up his own life in Santiago, Chile in the early 70’s, coming to the U.S. to help his brother, who had a scary accident that left him with an incapacitated arm. He made sure his brother’s medical bills were paid, working long hours and trying to adapt to American culture and the English language. Then he got lucky and met the love of his life, Ali.Getting married only 7 months after meeting on that blind date, Martin and Ali were very happy. It would take some time to adjust to an instant family. Then, a year and a half into the marriage, Martin was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, which was devastating for Martin and Ali. But it was agreed they would get through this and anything to come their way…together.As time progressed, so did Martin’s condition. With Multiple Sclerosis worsening, he was bound to a wheelchair, which was very difficult for him. Fast forward thirty years later and Martin would no longer be able to move any of his limbs, rendering him quadriplegic. He could no longer do anything for himself and needed constant care. The very simple things like eating, drinking, bathing, and everything else most of us take for granted, were no longer possible for Martin to do on his own. We can only imagine how incredibly difficult that must be, but have no idea what torment he goes through. But it is amazing how sometimes the love of a good woman can help someone through a difficult life.   In the last 6 months, Martin had been getting more frequent infections, thus in and out of the hospital. Most recently, he was hospitalized for over 5 weeks due to complications from a colonoscopy that resulted in him having a tracheotomy and a feeding tube (peg) to feed him. Although this was a last resort, Ali and Martin knew it would be the best option for him to prevent any further complications. Martin, he often mentions to Ali that he just wants to make sure he is here to celebrate their 40th anniversary February 4th.With this new life style of adjusting to the trach and feeding tube, on top of the effects of Multiple Sclerosis, it became evident right away that Martin would need 24-hour care from an LPN or RN, with the experience and credentials to handle a trach and feeding tube competently. Ali is Martin’s primary care giver. She is in her seventies and physically and emotionally unable to care for Martin day and night as it is impossible. Her health has been affected due to the constant stress and physical demands of having to care for Martin. But Ali has always promised Martin that she would never put him in a Medicare/county approved nursing facility. She would rather suffer and jeopardize her health than put Martin into a facility, in which he would likely decline. Ali and Martin are on a fixed income and unable to afford the cost of 24-hour care, which would roughly be $600 a day (average hourly rate of $25), which would be $4,200 a week.I am Ali’s daughter and Martin’s step-daughter, Kimberly. I have to say, It is heart-wrenching to see Ali cry multiple times a day, every day from physical and emotional exhaustion, frustration, and helplessness. Knowing that this terribly stressful situation is affecting my mom’s heath is scary and we are very concerned. Martin feels helpless when he sees his wife of almost 40 years distraught from exhaustion, but knows he is unable to do anything. My nine-year old son will often help his grandmother when he sees her crying or just because he knows she needs the physical help, which in turn is emotional support for her as well. He has love and compassion in his heart and that is beautiful. Although Ali has a lot of pride, she finally agreed with me creating the Gofundme page.I am asking for your help in donating what you can. Even if you can’t, I understand. I would ask you to please share this with as many people as possible…that is very helpful and still giving. We are grateful for your help.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/do-it-for-daxton,#doitfordaxton,"On January 28,2016, Daxton Layne McGehee was born.  He spent 5 days in neonatal ICU. He went home when he was 6 days old and then at 4 weeks of age he was re-admitted to the hospital with irregular breathing.  It was then they started all of his testing and decided to put him on oxygen and sleep apnea monitor, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. One of the many things we need for Daxton is what they call a portable concentrator. This would make it easier to motivate around with Daxton as the oxygen he uses now is very confining.  Thru many doctor visits, hospital visits and testing, at 8 months old Daxton received his diagnosis. He was diagnosed with a rare neurological form of sleep apnea called, Severe Central Sleep Apnea and hypoxemia. 30 days later we noticed another change in Daxton. He started having what they call, neurological seizures.  Our last visit to the neuro Dr. he decided that Daxton needs to be seen at one of the best hospitals in the world, Boston General, specializing in Severe Central Sleep Apnea. At Boston General they will be able to run tests that can't be done here in Oklahoma. At this hospital they also do many ""trials"" for his condition.  We are just wanting answers and be able to help Daxton live as normal a life as any other 1 year old. Daxton has already defied the odds, due to his mothers knowledge and how she stayed alert to him and his irregular breathing.

She suffered broken bones, severe bruising and underwent an intense surgery. We are lucky she is still here with us. Due to the severity of her bruising and the seriousness of her surgery (I will spare everyone the gruesome details and try to protect a little of Meg's privacy), her recovery has been slow and challenging. She has a long road ahead but is making baby steps everyday, figuratively and literally. In addition to her health challenges, she is about to go through a mountain of financial strains (you know the drill with these pages).... Megan and Adam just bought a house in November and now will be facing deductibles, replacing a car and the income gap from Megan having been unable to work. She was talking about trying to start back in the coming weeks. Due to the timing of the accident, Megan will need to pay her HIGH deductible in 2016, which I'm sure she surpassed, and her medical bills related to her recovery in 2017 until she meets her deductible (she should find out soon if additional surgery is necessary). Also, her leased car was totalled resulting her having to pay her car insurance deductible and be left with no trade-in or deposit for a new car. I never thought I would start one of these pages and I wouldn't do it if it were anyone else. I haven't told Megan so whoever tells her first, be ready for a shock :).

I have had pain in my right side that has been going on for over a year and continues to get worse. I have had an appendectomy and my gall bladder removed so they have ruled out those things out as causing my pain. My family and I have tried everything we know and exhausted our financial resources trying to get something done to no avail.  I am in excruciating pain most of the time and cannot sleep.  I have been to the Emergency Room on numerous occasions and because I do not have and cannot afford health insurance nor do I have the money to pay them, they will not do the expensive tests a GI Doctor said I need done to pinpoint and fix the problem. It will probably require surgery since he thinks it is either scar tissue built up from previous surgeries I have had and/or a blockage in my intestines according to my symptoms. Several ER doctors have not helped me, some of them being completely rude to me.  I have also tried to get Indigent care and TennCare/Medicaid but with all the new requirements, I do not qualify.  I have also applied for the Affordable Care Act and the cost per month is ridiculously high and I have not been able to work since all this has been going on.  I have become increasingly depressed over all of this. I have not been myself and I just want the problem fixed and to get my life back.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/healingtristen,Healing Tristen,"5 years ago, as a retired military family of four, we decided to open our home as foster parents.October 15, 2011 a scared, angry, confused 3½ yr old boy named Tristen was dropped off at our doorstep with a small blue bag of tattered belongings that had been through two other foster homes as well, and our journey began.Tristen was almost completely non-verbal. He knew a handful of words but communicated mostly by screaming and hitting and he often hid in his closet.  He could only eat with his fingers and carried his blanket with him desperately.We worked with Tristen and got him all the therapies we could to help. As he grew, we began to see what an amazingly smart, funny, and engaging little guy with whom we had the fortune of sharing our home. After 18 months in our home, the court effected termination of parental rights and on May 7, 2013, we officially adopted Tristen. Not long after that, the correct and heartbreaking diagnosis came... Reactive Attachment DisorderBecause of his past trauma, he was unable to trust adults and caregivers to provide him safety and love. That lack of trust has caused him to feel a primal need to fight for control to keep himself safe and avoids connections and true loving emotions at all costs.We found ourselves at home with a child that was beginning to feel that he can safely form a bond and attachment with his family and it scared him.  All of his fear and anger is directed at the people with whom he feels safest.  His parents, his mom mostly, through physical abuse - hitting, kicking, biting, hair pulling, throwing things, etc.  As much as we love our child, we were unsafe to be in our home with him. In the process of trying to restrain him during his physical outbursts to keep them both safe, his mother now has three herniated discs in her back and could no longer be alone with him because of the potential physical harm he could cause.Since the beginning of December 2016, Tristen went through three different acute hospitalizations. We are very aware now that these facilities could never provide him long-term meaningful healing.After Tristen's last acute hospitilization, we took a leap of faith and admitted him to the Villa Santa Maria at his therapist's recommendation.We have great hope and trust in this facility and can see their understanding of Reactive Attachment Disorder and passion for healing the children that suffer from it.  They are seasoned professionals that focus only on children with attachment and know how to understand and reach our son. This therapy does come at a considerable cost, however.  Texas Medicaid won't cover any of the treatment.  Our additional insurance won't cover this facility as well.  We have contacted our senators and congressmen and hope that his coverage will be reconsidered.  But in the meantime, we are doing in our hearts what we know is right for him.The treatment is intense.  The stay is long - likely 18 months.  The cost is high - over $10,000 a month.But the possible gains?  Worth every penny to us.  We will do whatever we can to give this boy the life he deserves.  The life he's always deserved.  Being a military family, asking for help does not come easily to us.  Being Tristen's parents has taught us so many things we never expected and one of those things is that it's not weakness to admit you don't have all the answers and need help. We don't want someone to give what they can't afford or feel obligated to do anything for us.  But if our little guy's story has touched your heart and you're able to support his therapy or share his story, we would be so very grateful.",https://images.gofundme.com/9khHy4NlqM39BF8ukepAR6bMq3M=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17216926_1488465613.185.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17216926_1484750128.0845_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17216926_1483637799.076_funddescription.jpg']",2,"Created January 5, 2017",Georgiana Koehl Ayer is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,350 raised of $189,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/baby-aarons-fight-against-hurler-syndrome,Baby Aaron's Fight Against MPS-I,"This page was made in order to help alleviate some of the many costs that will be incurred for Aaron Sharp's medical treatment, so that Angela and the Sharp family can focus on what's most important: Baby Aaron. Aaron Martin Sharp was born on March 11th, 2016. Full of personality, smiles, and a sweetheart just like his mother, Angela Sharp, Aaron has already brightened countless people's lives. Over the Holidays, The Sharp family received news that no one is ready to hear: Aaron has a very rare genetic disease called Hurler Syndrome, also known as MPS type 1. There is a continuous process in the human body of replacing used materials and breaking them down for disposal. Children with MPS are missing an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase which is essential in breaking down the mucopolysaccharides called dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The incompletely broken down mucopolysaccharides remain stored in cells in the body causing progressive damage. For more information on Hurler Syndrome, please go to: http://mpssociety.org/mps/mps-i/Hurler Syndrome does not have a cure as of this time, but treatments can be done to slow the progression and reduce some of the symptoms and pain involved with the rapid disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (which will be weekly IV infusions) and a Bone Marrow Transplant have already been discussed by Aaron's doctors. Unfortunately, since the disease is so rare, University of Michigan has not yet treated patients of Aaron's age. University of Minnesota has the treatment and providers able to help Baby Aaron fight this disease and slow its progression. As many people know already, Angela is an amazing, loving, selfless, hard-working single Mom who has already overcome many hurdles thrown her way in life. The treatment and the future Bone Marrow transplant will be very costly, with Angela having to move to Minnesota for at least 6 months in order to give Aaron the care that he needs. Any donation made will go towards the medical expenses, travel and accomodations, and missed wage expenses incurred. The path ahead will not be an easy one, but Angela, baby Aaron, the Sharp family, and their friends are ready to fight. Your help and your prayers are appreciated more than you will know. Thank you.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/phillipwesten,A healing Appalachian trail journey,"My name is Phillip and I Am hiking the Appalachian trail.  I am starting my hike on February 27, 2017. I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago and have been fighting and struggling with my own personal battles since. For me this has been a debilitating time and I have decided to make a plan and set a start date for adventure. I have decided to hike the Appalachian trail. I am planning this as a thru hike, completing the whole 2,190.3 miles in one full experience from start to finish. This for me and for many is a huge undertaking, and one for me I feel will help me with my PTSD. For starters even being able to plan this trip has been a huge accomplishment for myself (even though lots more to go) and has enabled me to break through some of those barriers that keep me from doing or accomplishing things I want to. From the waxing and waning of anxiety and depression debilitating me from doing everyday things. To the pain inducing nightmares and migraine robbing days. The appetite lost perpetuating the issue, the inability to leave the house or to work. Disability becomes the norm, the need for help and not knowing how or being able to ask. I have refrained thus far on my road from claiming disability (for me a crippling thing) I am determined to and will overcome any struggles I have. This trip will be very healing for me. I will be blogging and writing about my experience and psychological wanderings, (westenthewind.com) maybe they will help someone else who is going through similar things. I will also be making videos (from my phone for now) so that I can share the hiking experience with others whom maybe are unable to do such things. A chance for me to discover and share my process with others. (my uncle is wheelchair bound and I hope that the videos will help him to see things he normally cannot get to.) Maybe HP or GOPRO will answer my emails about helping me with equipment so I can make better videos.  Upon my journey to begin this trip, obtain the right equipment, and prepare enough food, I as many, am diligently planning and researching everything. Every ounce counts when your carrying it on you back for 5 or more months. And so does every penny. The Average thru hiker spends around $1,000 per month of hiking for supplies and food and lodging. I will lower this cost by taking rest days on the trail and staying in hotels or hostels as little as possible. I am also preparing most of my food and meals at home before I go. Dehydrating and vacuum sealing meals for easy cooking on the trail. And because my amazing parents are willing to help by mailing me restock packages along the way. Thank you Mom and Dad!!!  I am so lucky to have my parents and their support, they have been my rocks throughout this time. Helping me through my initial diagnosis, (debilitating PTSD, anxiety and depression) to the life changing traumatic events, that seem to cascade after, from compounding circumstance to explosive events, a road of recovery to rolling my car to almost loosing my hand, a dislocated shoulder in multiple places to a broken patella, to assisting with hours of therapy both physical and mental. I would not have even reached this point without them. As my time narrows down and my start date gets closer, a few final pieces of equipment to get, and some more food to prepare, things are starting to come together and this trip is becoming more and more a reality. At least as of now I will be fully prepared to hike sans a proper backpack (I can just use some wheelie luggage right?), just not sure how to fund the actual hiking and the getting to the start of the trail. For me it is easiest and best if I drive (I don't do well at airports or busses or trains). And There are the occasional times where I will want a hot meal, a bowl of ice cream, a hot shower, or need some supplies or replacement gear. Like paints and sketchbooks. (phillipwesten.com) I am in need of Help. I will be doing this trip no matter what, it would just be a lot nicer with food and the right equipment. A little financial backup will help with some of the anxiety and panic attacks surrounding this. I need help. I need your help to make this a magical experience. I need help to have this experience to share this experience. thank you.",https://images.gofundme.com/C88j4C0rtgxVV5zI6_c2S3lzYN4=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17217414_1483636760.8961.jpeg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Phillip Westen is organizing this fundraiser.,Travel & Adventure,"$1,600 raised of $7,000 goal"

My name is Sarah Herold, and for those who have known me, know that softball has been my passion since I started playing at age 5. I am currently approaching my junior year season at Denison University. While attending Denison, I was All-Tournament Team my freshmen year, and Second Team All-Conference and First Team All-Region my Sophomore year. Those were huge accomplishments for me, and I cannot wait to see what this upcoming season will bring! Aside from softball, I manage to keep myself busy with my schoolwork. I am a Chemistry major with a minor in Latin. With a Chemistry major, I will go to medical school to study Reconstructive Surgery. My ultimate goal is to serve in the Air Force, where I plan on being a reconstructive surgeon for burn victims. So many of you are probably thinking, why is she asking us to fund her? Well, this summer, I was given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play softball on the lovely continent of Australia. I was picked to represent the United States in the 2017 International Softball Challenge in Sydney, Australia. The program behind this is USA International Athletes, and they are sponsoirng this team to go to Australia which offers a great opportunity for international sporting, as well as a cultural experience like no other. This is a wonderful opportunity to play against other countries, while promoting friendship among nations and the game of softball! Therefore, I am asking for help to fund this opportunity for me. I love softball and I would give anything to experience playing softball in this amazing country, while representing the United States. I will also take away the gainings of this experience to my future career. Anything you can offer is appreciated, and I thank you in advance for helping me reach this goal!-Sarah Herold",https://images.gofundme.com/iy1gQHgWaiUrDKz2B3R3y-izt0o=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17217576_1483636821.1169.jpg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Sarah Herold is organizing this fundraiser.,"Sports, Teams & Clubs","$1,575 raised of $5,000 goal"

Here is Nancy's story in her own words:  In 2015 I found a lump in my left tricep.  I had an ultrasound and they found that it was a tumor with a blood source. In September 2015, I had surgery to have the tumor removed. At first I was told the tumor was benign, but after some slicing and dicing and three pathologists later, it turned out to be cancer, a soft tissue sarcoma, which is a rare form of cancer. Surgery was followed by a chest CT and radiation on the arm for 5 days a week for 6 weeks.  At the end of radiation I had a gnarly scar but I was sure I was done with this nonsense.  But wait, there's more. That initial CT found a small lung nodule, which was too small to be biopsied so it was going to be watched. In May there was another CT.... initial nodule hadn't grown but a new one popped up.... now instead of watching one, we were watching two, Then in late October another CT showed all the nodules had grown and there were new ones. A whirlwind of tests began starting with a PET scan and ending with a lung biopsy. On 12/9/2016 I was told that I have stage IV sarcoma.  BALLS!!!!!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-graham,Support Graham!,"Why am I wanting funding?  I was diagnosed with a Grade III brain tumor, Cancer in December 2016. I was lucky in being able to have surgery and have it removed but come July 2017 another had grown and I had surgery again.  My type of tumor is seen as a terminal illness if it's a Grade IV and I will be lucky to have a year or two of surving at most since chemotherapy failed in preventing the second tumor from growing.   Come 2019 I became very unwell throughout the winter and it came to a point where I suddenly became unable to say more than two words, even writing followed the same. This was a reaction in more cancer cells have developed within my brain and causing an instant chemotherapy in hopes of removing the new cells. It has appeared in a much deeper place than those previous ones and if not removed is very worrying I may not be living for much longer.  I am asking for funding in the hopes I can be happy knowing people care in helping me afford what I would like for my wife and children before I go. The funding was originally to aim for a nice big shed for my children to have their very own play area since our home is quite small, this however is now pointless as our home is too small for when my condition becomes worse. All donations will help in moving house to where when my condition becomes worse a bedroom on the bottom floor would be made as well as provide bedrooms for each child.  If you cannot donate, Please at least share this.  [ My Story - Short] (Long story below)  On December 7th 2016 I was rushed to Hospital because of being dizzy, confused, disorientated, being sick multiple times and problems with my memory (not knowing my age).  After a CT scan I was found to huge a huge brain tumor and was taken to Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield.  Surgery was performed to remove as much as possible of the tumor on December 9th and a week was spent recovering in hospital before being able to come home on December 13th.Two weeks later the diagnosis of the tumor was identified as a Anaplastic Gemistocytic Astrocytoma , which is a Level III tumor and is Cancer. (1 being lowest, 4 being worst).  With only a 30% chance of living for 5 years I've decided to ask for help in being able to reach some life goals as said at the start of the page..  [My Story - Long]  Hi!My name is Graham and since September 2016 I've been very unwell.It started off as a persistant headache, Multiple trips to the GP resulted in an increase in painkillers and even referals to A&E at hospital.It started off as an ear infection and a tonsillitis so an ear spray and antibiotics for a week was perscribed. The unusual thing about this was the headache, It was very persistant and wasn't stopping even with painkillers.After the week and still in pain, another trip to a GP and was perscribed Co-codamol and ibuprofen. These tablets slighty helped in pain but I was starting to show difficulty in walking straight and starting to wobble and my eye sight was getting blurry.  I contacted a GP by telephone and was referred to going to A&E to see if they can help. I went and was first seen by a nurse who gave me a codine tablet which definetly helped with the pain which I was then seen by a hospital GP.  He tested me and diagnosed it was looking like Cluster Headaches and that I was to be perscribed specific painkillers to help.I was switched to another department where I was told there was nothing they can perscribe and I need to get reffered to another department by my own GP.The difficulty here is my memory starting to get worse, easily forgetting what I'm being told.I then contacted my GP and told him what I was able to remember about the referal and he said it wasn't required yet and to go pickup a perscription he made for some Atenolol which after afew days didn't do anything to help the pain which had returned.  The painkillers I had stopped helping the pain and I made an emergency appointment with my GP to see what they could do and I was simply messed around. Since it's not a booked appointment it's a random GP and this one didn't decide to help and infact claimed I was just depressed and should join a group. So I left in pain.  Few days later I attented my appointment for a fasting blood test to see if I was diabetic. When I was in the chair having my arms checked for veins I was very tired and my head was nodding up and down and the nurse refused to do the blood test and passed me onto a GP.  I explained everything to this GP and he tested my eyes and came up with the idea something was very wrong with my vision. By this time half of each eye was not able to see. I was sent to A&E again.  This time I was seen by a vision doctor who didn't see any problems with my eye and all he could do is perscribe some Codeine 30mg tablets.These were fantastic in removing the pain but the side effects of difficulty sleeping and constipation was annoying at times.  Everything was aiming at being Cluster Headaches or diabetes.Two weeks later my vision was still very poor and becoming worse. I went to a local pharmacy that provided a diabetes test and had one done. My sugar level was seen as low and was told to goto my doctors for yet another fasting bloodtest. The nearest appointment wasn't until the week after. Afew days later and I became very dizzy and difficult in moving my partner rang 111 in getting help and a Ambulence was brought over.  The paramedics performed several tests and my sugar level then was 2.7 and recommended I go with them to the hospital. Once I got there with them I was taken to a department where I was to stay overnight and have my sugar level checked every so many hours.  I was unable to sleep and was awake all day and night, It was evident that I had trouble walking straight and even my vision. Many nurses noticed this and showed concern.  The next day the doctor came and checked all my results explaining it's not showing I have diabetes and requested a family background of who had it. I was simply let free without any medication and went home and finally managed to sleep.  The results from my blood test came a week after to show no issues at all. However the problems increased, intense head pain when laying down so was not able to sleep, appitite was gone so was not able to eat much. I was so tired and in pain daily all I could do is try to sleep.  I was starting to show the same effects as before when my sugar level was low and my partner contacted 111 again to have an Ambulence come and perform the tests again. This time my sugar level wasn't so low and the paramedics suggested having my GP perform a home visit to help. They contacted him and he refused to do a home visit and instead insisted I go to A&E again.  I was taken to A&E and had to wait in a small room for several hours just to be seen by a doctor who didn't care for my pain and decided my issues are all because of depression because of how much work is required at home and because my oldest son is disabled. Yet again I was simply let go free with no help and I returned home in pain. While the codeine was helping reduce the pain, it was slowly over time loosing it's effect and I visited my GP to be told to increase it from one tablet to two.  I now started to be unable to sleep flat on a bed, Whenever lying down flat I would get a severe pain in my head which would stop if I got up. I had to pile up alot of pillows so I was sitting up to be able to sleep.  Moving on to December where it came worse. I was perscribed sleeping tablets to try and help get some sleep. On my first day I was sick in the morning, This was suspected to be because of that tablet. I tried again just to make sure and an hour after taking this tablet I was violently sick on the bed.  I stopped taking the sleeping tablets as they didn't help and wasn't worth being sick.  The third day is when it became worse, I didn't take the tablet but I woke up at night and while I was going to be sick I couldnt navigate myself out of the bedroom. I was dizzy and confused as to where I was and ended up stood still infront of a cabinet unable to move to the door. I was violently sick all across my room before being able to make it to the toilet.  My partner had become seriously worried in the condition I had reached as I wasn't stable at all, She rang 999 for an emergency ambulance but they were delayed and we had to wait.  During this wait I tried to stomach food, water or even medicine and just kept being sick. Several hours had passed and being sick had stopped but I was severely tired and exhausted. It was 4am and still no ambulance, We fell asleep  while waiting on our bed.An hour later and the ambulance had arrived and come upto our room to wake us up. Simple tests had been performed and I had forgotton most of what had happened, I even incorrectly answered how old I was and didn't know where I was.  I was rudely treated by the paramedic as if I was a drug user and offered no help in moving and I felt as if I was being forced to goto A&E because I ""wasted his time"". I had to dress myself and stumble downstairs to then walk outside in the rain and let myself into the Ambulance car,  Thankfully this is most likely what saved my life.  I was taken down to my local hospital in Chesterfield where a CRT scan was performed. That picture above shows you what I saw.  It certainly wasn't a Cluster headache as I thought, It was a brain tumor. The nurse was almost in tears as she showed it me and told me I was to be emergency ran to Sheffield Hallemshire Hospital. I was pretty shocked but at least out of pain.  After going to the new hospital throughout the morning I was still unable to sleep but felt comfortable and out of pain. The next day I had a MRT scan, the next day was surgery. Waking up with a tight headcover and covered in wires with more than enough needle injections was a surprising state to wake up to!It took over a week after surgery for me to gain enough health to return home. Which I was so happy to do and be able to rest and see my three children.So what's the after effects of surgery? Well here's a fancy explanation found in a ""Dealing with a brain tumor"" which best explain whats happening.  Semantic memory not being able to describe and give meaning to our world. For example, naming a city or describing what a cat is.Episodic memory not remembering specific events and experiences you have lived through such as what happened at a relative's birthday.Retrograde amnesia Loss of memories formed before you had a brain tumour or treatment.Anterograde amnesia Difficulty remembering memories formed after you had a brain tumour or treatment.Dysphasiayou forget the beginning of what has been saidhaving difficulty understanding if there is background noise or several people speaking at oncebeing able to describe an object, but not name itCognitive impairmentThinking speed may be slower, making it more difficult to keep up with conversationsReaction times may be slowerVision and perceptionDifficulties recognising objects, people, words or sounds, such as recognising a pen on a cluttered desk  As terrible as it sounds hopefully through time they'll repair and things will improve.  Move forward two weeks and the appointment is ready, to find out what the tumor was, and it was a Anaplastic Gemistocytic Astrocytoma.  A rare cancer that 1 in 5000 can get and is very persistant in growing and mine was said to be as big as an golf ball/egg, but thankfully not spreading.While it might look scary, It actually didn't hurt that much at all. Thankfully the clips was removed after a week and half of surgery but it certainly went high up on my head.The surgery had managed to remove alot but not all of it and I require Chemotherapy and Radiology in hope of removing the last of it.  I have three children. Our oldest is 6 , second oldest is three and the youngest is two years old. So alot of work is needed which is difficult alone and will be for my wife. Thank you for reading.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/BeLoudBeAWarriorBeJoeBeard2017,Joe Beard Deserves Viking Memorial!,"Joe 'Beard' Aichele was one of the most genuine, bold, unique, hilarious, loving, loud Viking this world had ever seen. Normally I'd explain a person like him as someone who could light up every room and life he entered but honestly he set a light so bright that I rather compare it to a wild fire. There's way to much to say about him, he was my soulmate, he was a brother, a best friend, a giant pain in the butt in the best way possible. He was the kind of man that would work all day then go to school where he would then stay late to tutor other class mates and ask nothing in return. He applied this kind of selflessness to his everyday life. Always giving to his friends and family. He was happy knowing they were happy. I want to raise money to give him the memorial he really deserved. He always wanted a viking funeral but sadly it's not possible so the next best thing is a giant bonfire, a giant loud memorial for us to grieve properly and for everyone who loved and cherished him, he wouldn't want it any other way. 1500 just seemed like a good number to me but the more I am able to raise, the more I want to do in his honor. I wanna make sure our family is cared for and have the ability to pay off the cremation and memorial hall fees.I want to also make donations to cancer research because as those who knew him knows he lost his mother exactly a year ago to cancer, as those who know me know I lost my father this summer to cancer.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/eric-bauserman-memorial-fund,Eric Bauserman Memorial Fund,"Eleven years ago at the age of thirty-five, Eric Bauserman, was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma. He was the father of three very young kids at that time: Jenna (10), Jared (5), and Jace (1). This remarkable man continued to work to support his family through all he endured over the next eleven years. He never once asked for help, never looked for a hand out, and never complained. His Hodgkins came back twice after initial diagnosis, and his treatments included chemo and radiation, a stem cell transplant, a bone marrow transplant, surgeries of all types including maggot therapy, and ongoing photopheresis to help calm his GVH. Eric pushed on, always looking to the future. He would take chemo treatments on Thursdays so he could recoup over the weekend to be back to work on Mondays. Through it all, Eric not only worked but volunteered his time to scouting and Little League. He was a most remarkable father, always attending Jenna's plays and Jace and Jared’s games, no matter how much he hurt. In the last few years, Eric was forced to stop working—his semi-weekly treatments for GVH made it impossible. The burden to financially care for his family fell upon his wife, Shannon. Shannon not only cared for Eric and the kids full-time, but worked a full-time job as well. We lost Eric on Wednesday, December 28, 2016. He is now at peace. Eric treated every person he met like family. Over 400 people attended his memorial this past Tuesday, a testimony to the impact Eric had on those he knew. It’s our hope that those of you who read about this man, whether you knew him or not, will help him provide ongoing financial support for his young family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/skylartucci,Love for Skylar Rose,"This is the story of Skylar Rose Tucci – a smart, sweet, caring 3-year-old little girl and big sister from New York, NY. It was Wednesday, December 28th 2016, two days before her 3rd birthday (the party at a local kids’ gym was all planned). Her parents, though, became concerned about rashes spreading throughout her unusually pale skin. Routinely, the doctor drew blood and sent her home.  That night, alarmingly, Skylar’s parents were instructed by the doctor to rush her to the Emergency Room, where a multitude of tests were run. Then, the family learned the heartbreaking reality: Skylar was diagnosed with Leukemia. Chemotherapy was to begin in two days, but the doctor pushed it back one more day, so Skylar could celebrate her birthday with her family – not at the kids’ gym but in a hospital room.  Sam, Michael, Skylar & Bella’s lives have obviously been changed completely, as this sweet, innocent, and loveable little girl just began what the doctors say will be a minimum of 2 ½ years of Chemo. This is a very serious disease, but Skylar is in great hands at the hospital where she has a great team caring for her, in addition to the unconditional love and support of her parents and baby sister. This is going to be a long road for the Tucci family, emotionally, physically, and financially – with 2 ½ years of treatment and at least the next month of hospital room and board. As friends and family are learning this news and thinking of all of the wonderful memories that they’ve shared with Skylar, many are asking what they can do to help. For those who are able, we are asking on the Tuccis’ behalf to help support them in any way possible. No matter how large or small, your individual gift can make a real impact and give them one less thing to worry about during this trying time. All money raised will go directly to Sam and Michael to help pay the medical bills that come with treating Childhood Leukemia in NYC. Their family will be so grateful for your generosity, your love, and your support. They will look to this when they themselves feel tired and hopeless, and they will thank you!If this is the first you’re hearing about this, please understand that Sam and Michael are still in the very early stages of processing all of this.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-call-to-the-nations-israel,ISRAEL - To Know Him More,"Dear Friends-               This summer I will be traveling to Israel to experience ‘The Holy Land’ and walk where Jesus walked.  To know His heartbeat and the beautiful nation that is so precious to Him.  My first desire to go to Israel derived from a prayer; to know Jesus more intimately.  That same exact night of sharing my desire with the Lord; He opened the opportunity for me to go Israel.  He is such a gracious Father.                 You see, not only do I want to know Jesus’ roots but I have a call on my life to bring the Gospel to the Nations and Israel is one of them.  It is going to be such a joy to bless the people and to share the love of Jesus.  I will be traveling with world renowned Evangelists; we will be exploring the land, praying for the people, and healing will take place as the manifestation of God’s presence invades the atmosphere.  With everything that has been currently taking place regarding Israel as a Nation, I believe the time is now, to bring the Glory of the Lord upon that land and its people.  Israel is God’s treasure and I’m beyond excited and expectant to see how Jesus is going to show up amongst us. He is going to invade all our hearts and I will be forever changed as He encounters me in His homeland.               I come to you today, asking that if the Spirit lays it upon your heart to financially bless this trip and call upon my life, that you would please do so.  It will not only impact me but also impact the people who reside there; I will be catapulted into my destiny to share the love of His Son with the Nations - All for the Glory of His Kingdom.  I graciously thank you for your kindness and support – May the Lord Bless You for Blessing Me.All His Promises are Yes & Amen....Abundant Blessings!-Lea RomanoISAIAH 62:4 Never again will you be called “The Forsaken City” or “The Desolate Land.”  Your new name will be “The City of God’s Delight” and “The Bride of God,” for the Lord delights in you and will claim you as his bride.ISAIAH 62:11-12 The Lord has sent this message to every land: “Tell the people of Israel, ‘Look, your Savior is coming.  See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.’”  They will be called “The Holy People” and “The People Redeemed by the Lord.”  And Jerusalem will be known as “The Desirable Place” and “The City No Longer Forsaken.”$4000 before June 2017.",https://images.gofundme.com/3QSOkLFR84XPXWbx1LRExyk93wA=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218232_1488657983.0017.jpg,[],0,"Created January 5, 2017",Lea Romano is organizing this fundraiser.,"Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$1,592 raised of $4,570 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/imanis-battle-with-sickle-cell,Imani’s battle with sickle cell,"Ebony Bayes and Quentin Cooper had a beautiful daughter name Imani on September 2, 2010. After the doctor ran a few test they were delivered the news that Imani has sickle cell. It has been a struggle since Imani was diagnosed with Sickle Cell Anemia at birth. Although she is growing up and appears to be a normal 6-year-old, Imani has been fighting this internal battle everyday since she was born.What happens when you have sickle cell anemia? In layman’s terms – It is a red blood cell disorder where these oxygen carrying cells are not formed the way they should be. Normal cells are round and a person who has sickle cell has sickle shape cells. Since the blood cells are abnormal, the lack of tissue oxygen can cause sudden attack and excruciating pain in a person’s body. These pain attacks can occur without warning, and a person often needs to go to the hospital for effective treatment.Imani’s Fight- She has been in the hospital yearly. On December 25, 2016 Imani was on a trip visiting family in Henderson, NC. She was in severe pain and we immediately drove from Henderson to Durham, North Carolina to Duke hospital. Imani received a blood transfusion when she arrived to the hospital. The doctor then informed us Imani suffered a mini stroke. She is still hospitalized and fighting for recovery. This is where family, friends, and the community steps in!! Please help Imani with her courageous fight against this illness. This fund will be used to offset travel cost, lodging, meals and medical expenses. Every little bit will help. We thank you from the bottom of our heart!! Imani is our hero, and we love her more than anything in this world. She is nothing less than a Sickle Cell Warrior and We Will Fight this battle together no matter what.",https://images.gofundme.com/13VfAZEhF0yMlxsW385WwHuLh9c=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218250_1483638531.9517.jpg,[],0,"Created January 7, 2017",Rasheda Bey-Adams is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Ebony Bayes.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,960 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/loveforlexibriley,Love for Lexi,"Late at night on January 1, Lexi was the passenger in a car that was involved in a serious accident. She sustained many serious injuries including fractured ribs, fractured humerus, severe laceration to her scalp, fractured skull, blood on her brain, fractured C4 vertebrae, and fractured facial bones.  She was transported to UC West Chester but then was transferred immediately by Care Flight to UC Neuro-Science ICU due to the severity of her brain injury.  She's been in the NSICU since. The most severe issue right now is the blood on her brain, as it is located in the area that controls her speech. We won't know how big of an issue this is until she wakes up.  Tessa and Tony do have health insurance so they were resistant to this page being created. Our hope is this fund can help offset all of the extraneous costs associated with this tragic accident.  Tessa may not be back to work for a while, as Lexi is going to need her mama with her constantly. Once Lexi is out of the hospital, rehabilitation appointments will begin. Tessa and Tony have so much on their plate right now and it is our hope that they won't have to worry about finances on top of everything else.  We appreciate all of the love, support, and prayers.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kodisamarohipsurgery,Kodi Samaro Hip Replacement Surgery,"Anyone who has met Billy or myself even once, knows how much we love our dog, Kodi (Kodiak) Bear.  He was a surprise Christmas present to me in 2012, and has been our baby ever since.  He has always been an avid frisbee player, and just the greatest dog for the last 4 years.  On October 27th, Kodi was attacked by the neighbor's 3 dogs, resulting in an injury to his right hip.  It quickly became apparent that this wasn't the type of injury that would heal on its own, or even with some simple veterinary care, so we sought out the help of an Orthopedist.  The latest update is that Kodi will need a full hip replacement in his right leg.  Kodi is only 4 years old, and has so much more life to live, so we know that this surgery is the best option for him.  Not only is he young, but the vet explained that Kodi is in fact in a lot of pain. X-rays show that his hip is actually rubbing bone-on-bone, which is incredibly painful, and is causing him to barely be able to walk.  For an active dog who loves spending days running around the yard, this is emotionally painful as well. The funds raised here, which are GREATLY appreciated, will go directly to the cost of Kodi's surgery (which is $10,000), of which his insurance covers $0.  Due to our family growing (Baby Samaro due April 6th) this is an expense we were not planning for at this time. Even your positive thoughts for him during this time are appreciated.",https://images.gofundme.com/unJWaxYNMej1tmosLHaDHYw5CNk=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218294_1483639040.6096.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218294_1483640239.2622_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218294_1483640263.3309_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218294_1483640300.0268_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218294_1483640315.0186_funddescription.jpg']",4,"Created January 5, 2017",Leslie Samaro is organizing this fundraiser.,Animals & Pets,"$2,155 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/we-the-darts,We Heart The Dart's ❤️,"UPDATE!!!!Kylee Dart has found her heart!!!Susan was at CHOP with Kylee for a heart catheterization already when the transplant team came in and broke the news this afternoon. We don't know from where or from whom the heart is coming, but we are told that it is the perfect heart for her.  We are both overwhelmed with gratitude and amazed that what was supposed to be over a year wait for a heart to become available was not even 4 months.  We are somewhat overwhelmed.  This is it.  BUT, we know that God has brought her this far has made her stronger now than she ever has been.  We don't know too many details, other than transplant will happen tonight.  We appreciate all the prayers you have to offer.We'll share as we get more detail.----------------------------------------------------If you're reading this, you very well may know Ed and Susan Dart and their 4 kids: Cora (11), David (10), Maggie (7) and Kylee (4 1/2). Kylee was born essentially with half of a functioning heart, only having a single (right) ventrical. Kylee unofficially became part of the Dart family at 7 weeks old, when she was released from CHOP into the Chester County foster care system. But she wasn't officially added to their family until August 1, 2014 when her adoption was finalized. Since her birth, she's gone through three reconstructive open heart surgeries and in November 2016, had two more back-to-back to place a synthetic valve and pacemaker. All gave her a great chance of making it many years with her anatomy, until December 30, 2016. During a routine follow up visit, Kylee's cardiologist shared that she was in significant heart failure and needed an almost immediate admission for IV drugs, and with anticipation of needing a heart transplant. She's been back at CHOP now since New Year's Eve and continued to worsen until the doctors determined that implantation of a ventricular assist device (VAD) was not only necessary but urgent. The VAD will act as a bridge to heart transplant, which she has now been listed for, status 1A (highest priority). There's a chance that she could be sent home on the VAD, but it remains to be seen. This hospital stay is expected to last anywhere from 2 1/2 months to 9 months, or longer, depending on whether or not she has to remain hospitalized until transplant. The VAD itself will have Kylee tethered to a 2-ft power chord and battery backup cable until the Lord provides a donor heart. She'll miss her beloved baths and swimming in the pool, but there's hope that one day in the next two years she'll be able to return to a normal life.  As you can imagine, having to sustain a months-long hospital stay is a grueling task. While Susan is at Kylee's side 24/7 at CHOP, Ed is holding down the fort at home with the other kids and working full time. Thankfully, several very compassionate and loving people have volunteered to homeschool the kids. But, as you can imagine, the financial impact of a months-long hospital stay can really become a strain. Among other things,-Susan purchases most of her meals at the hospital-The 100 mile round trip is made several times a week eats up gas and it costs to park, although it's a nominal fee considering it's center city Philadelphia.- Ed and Susan need to avail themselves of convenience as often as possible to keep sane-The kids need some additional distractions and need to feel special as so much of their parents' focus is directed toward their younger sister.-Adjustments will need to be made to their home to accomodate Kylee's VAD.If this stay were to be a couple of weeks, it would be pretty easy for them to float the additional expenses. But an indefinite stay will bring challenges on all sides. They face an uphill battle to juggle all things and preserve their family cohesion being separated, but confident that the Lord will provide all they need.Ed and Susan have spent their lives caring for, helping, loving and serving others in a myriad of ways and now we have a chance to help lighten their load in a small way.  The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.” Deuteronomy 31:8",https://images.gofundme.com/fa4OyuNI4CIFo5ik8e4zwDVF35Y=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17218426_1483933322.552.jpg,[],0,"Created January 18, 2017",Alicia Murphy is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Ed Dart.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$15,765 raised of $15,000 goal"

We did not catch it in time and the flu made his immune system susceptible to bacterial growth. It progressed into staph pneumonia in his lungs and caused him to go into septic shock. The hospital was unable to get his breathing under control so he was forced to go onto a vent and be sedated. The following day, Jerry coded and CPR was performed  for 32 minutes. When they backed off the sedation we found that he was responsive. Ever since that day it complicated matter a bit. It has been a struggle to maintain his vitals at a stable level. They moved him onto a rotating bed that let's him lay down on his stomach without putting immense pressure. He just recently got to the point where he is able to lay one his back for extended periods of time, but he is still in critical condition . People have asked how they can help. We ask for your prayers. If you feel like you want to do more we set up this go fund me for medical expenses. With everything he is going through this will not be cheap. We set an arbitrary amount.

Tim went to the Emergency Room at a local San Diego Hospital on Dec 28th for something unrelated. The Hospital staff did a blood test which is common practice. The next day, on Dec 29th, which was also Tim's Birthday he received a phone call from a Doctor telling him that the blood test showed he has advanced Leukemia. Tim was immediately admitted to the hospital on his birthday and started chemo treatments the very next day. His hospital stay is going to be for one to three months.  Once he goes home he will not be able to return to work for an additional 6 months. Tim is a cameraman for a local San Diego News Station, but he is considered an Independent Contractor which means he has no benefits through that TV Station. This is going to be a very big financial hardship for Tim since there will be no income in the weeks and months ahead. Tim has always been a hard working person and always willing and eager to help people if they were in need, so I felt that this is the time that Tim needs a little help himself. If anyone is financially able to help Tim out during this difficult journey that is just beginning, it would be greatly appreciated.
