https://www.gofundme.com/f/japanese-garden-renovation,Japanese Garden at Monte Sano,"A quick history: The North Alabama Japanese Garden was started in 1988 in the Monte Sano State Park as just a hobby garden and something to enjoy doing with my children. Maybe a couple hundred square feet next to a swamp or bog in a place the park gave me to plant and improve an area not traveled by many.In 1991, we built a Tea House to give it some Japanese character and started an annual spring festival in 1992. This continued for about 15 years and then the garden and Tea House started falling into disrepair. I fell into disrepair also with cancer and had to take a break from work involving any physical labor.Now we are rebuilding the bridges, the Tea House, and all other structures, improving some of the garden with Japanese Maples and a raked stone garden. We have a team of volunteers working hard to make the Japanese garden beautiful again. We also are working very hard to preserve the natural beauty of the mountain top area, and the native plants and azaleas in this area. We have formed a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization so that we can get sponsors and donations to help us make it new and safe A.D.A. compliant.The donations will help in paying for the materials used to rebuild the Japanese garden, as well as cost for the continuous repairs and maintenance to make the garden beautiful and maintain the condition for generations to come.Thank you,Robert Black",https://images.gofundme.com/zt2u367XT9e6tV20QOdTnLJz3Vk=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17144028_1483386913.8518.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Robert  Black is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Japanese Garden Our Town Charity Foundation.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$2,705 raised of $30,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/copstopguardian,Cop Stop Guardian Traffic Stop App,"Cop Stop Guardian... Curing ""Police-Itis"" One Stop At A Time!    Join The Cop Stop Guardian Movement!In America, there are over a thousand violent to deadly police encounters with American citizens every year. These encounters wreak havoc on the lives of all the people involved and create an air of fear and distrust between citizens and law enforcement, thereby widening the gap of communication and pathways to a better solution. Well, we at Cop Stop Guardian™  feel that we have found a way to close that gap and bring about a practical, beneficial and pro-active solution. We all know that Everyone wants to get home safely from any police stop,  citizens AND officers alike, and some of the main obstacles preventing this from happening are...1. A fear of bodily injury from the Citizen by the officer and vice-versa.2. An ignorance of one’s own civil rights and proper pull over procedure.3. Lack of education and awareness of local laws that govern basic police stops 4. Improper training on behalf of law enforcement on how to lessen tensions without lethal violence.5. A few bad police officers who do not have the Citizen's best interest or preservation of rights in mind or at heart.So Cop Stop Guardian's Passion and Mission is to Serve as a pathway of communication between law enforcement and citizens during traffic stops until citizens, and police officers, gain the confidence and education to create a permanent relationship of trust, understanding, respect and eventually community between the two. How do we plan to do this you ask? With the Cop Stop Guardian SmartPhone App!You will be able to use The Cop Stop Guardian App to help you communicate effectively with law enforcement officers at traffic stops so that you may get home Safely, without physical injury or incident.App Features:When the App is activated, your camera is turned on and immediately begins recording the police stop. The Cop Stop Call Center is immediately notified and the App user's phone mic is automatically turned onto speaker mode. The call center operator will notify the officer that the traffic stop is being monitored by a third party video and audio recording service for the safety of both the driver and the officer(s).The Cop Stop Operator will ask the officer(s) for their name(s) and badge number(s) to submit for verification as well to file charges in case of any misconduct, while simultaneously sending out a #Cop Stop Flash Mob distress signal to other App users within a half a mile radius to Mob the traffic stop for Community support and extra video documentation. An Alert Notification will also be sent to App users nationwide regarding the traffic stop.The App will also contain...•All personal information relevant to traffic stop, I.e.… Drivers license information, if the driver is licensed to carry a firearm (if applicable as some states have open carry laws), Any sensitive medical condition(s) such as being hearing impaired, Foreign languages spoken etc..•Video Clips (as well as a virtual ""Legal Library"") teaching users Basic traffic and civil rights law as well as correct ""pull over"" procedures, which will include proper demeanor, rapport and articulation with law enforcement.•Online public forums to connect and encourage users across the country to establish law study and legislative activity groups. •It will contain links to facilitate connections between citizens and local law enforcement for a productive interaction on how to ease tensions and create trusting relationships within communities across America.•Trauma support groups for victims of police brutality and those injured during police traffic stops.AND SO MUCH MORE!!! Our goal and shared perspective is set on communication, Safety, community awareness and the combining of simple, proactive steps that can assist in building a new platform of trust between citizens and Law enforcement. That is why we have started our Cop Stop Community Watch Project Campaign.  WE NEED YOUR HELP to make this vision a reality! It's only through the support of one another that we will overcome these stressful and perilous times that plagued our country. With the creation and implementation of the Cop Stop Guardian App we can better service our Communities and help any and all who need assistance in their travels and experiences when dealing with law enforcement.Our Service to the Community is :Creating a safe third-party communication and accountability system for police stops in America.Empowering and bringing together Citizens and Law enforcement,  for a better understanding of how to alleviate the violence and tension that is prevalent today between these two communities. Educating all communities on local laws that govern traffic stops and laws that Secure their inalienable and unalienable Rights.Educating the public on proper demeanor, rapport and protocol required during a traffic stop.Ensuring law abiding officers are not falsely accused and unjustly persecuted .Creating a pro-active approach to the prevention and eventual eradication of  the many violent and deadly traffic stops that occur among Americans today. Creating a neutral, third-party national database on abusive and corrupt members of law enforcement who misuse their Authority.Reinvigorating a sense Justice among the People who fear unjust violence by corrupt police officers.DONATE AND HELP US MAKE THIS A REALITY!!!!",https://images.gofundme.com/_qMdxnoRJK_Iy83rS6IwXM71KW0=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tcnwJseei_Y/0.jpg,[],0,"Created January 18, 2017",Kevin Barringer is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Kevin Barringer.,Non-Profits & Charities,"$4,093 raised of $75,000 goal"

He was flown to a hospital in San Antonio, Texas due to a major head trauma resulting from the crash. As many of us gathered and prayed hoping God would grant Raul a second chance, we never realized that God had a greater plan for him. Raul entered the Kingdom of God on January 2, 2017 at 3:14 am, and he said see you soon to his family and friends. Raul, in the middle of his senior year in high school, was a boy filled with spirit, happiness, and love. He always kept a smile on his face, and brought even bigger smiles to the people around him. Everyone who knew him would agree when they say that his light-hearted spirit had a way of touching people’s hearts, and that is one thing that will always be remembered about him. In a way, Raul helped us all. As we say our final goodbyes to Raul, I ask of those who loved him and those who did not have the privilege of meeting him to lend a helping hand to his family with anything at all to help towards the funeral cost. Anything would be a great help in helping his family and our community commemorate the memory of a boy who brought a little more joy into our lives on and off the football field.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-fight-npc-and-take-a-trip,Help Tim Fight NPC,"Tim’s StoryMy brother, Tim, is fighting Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC). NPC is a very rare and terminal genetic disease that affects Tim’s ability to metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within a cell. Excessive amounts of lipids accumulate in the brain and cause cells to shutdown, therefore affecting Tim’s cognitive and motor abilities. There are only an estimated 500 cases of this disease worldwide and about 100 in the US. NPC is always fatal. Tim began to show symptoms years ago, but due to his Asperger’s Syndrome and the rareness of the disease it was difficult for doctors to diagnose him. The diseases has drastically progressed since I started this page. What started as clumsiness has developed into inability to walk on his own. The disease also affects his processing abilities. Tim tested in the second percentile for processing – meaning his ability to receive information, understand it and respond to it has extremely declined. This continues to decline. NPC has also caused Tim to have hearing loss requiring hearing aids. Every two weeks my family takes Tim to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago where he gets a spinal infusion of a trial drug, cyclodextrin. Tim has done this over 70 times. While the disease continues to progress, there's no knowing how much worse it could be without the infusions.When I first started this page, my brother was in the ICU fighting pneumonia and pleural effusion with serious complications that required surgery. He's heading back to the hospital for another surgery, but this time on his legs and feet. The goal is to make Tim's legs braceable so he can walk withe aids. I'm going to write a separate update with the details on this. *Please note with the progression of the disease it's difficult to keep this story up to date. GoFundMe automatically lands visitors on this page, please check my updates for the most recent developments in Tim's fight against NPC.How You Can HelpDonations will help cover the cost of the never ending medical bills (this latest hospital stay is sure to be costly), updates to my family's home to make it easier for Tim to get around (just installed a stairlift) and general cost of living as we’ve come to grips that Tim will never work again.Thank YouFirst, I want to thank you for visiting this page.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-eastons-medical-bills,Help with Easton's Medical Bills,"Hello.  My name is Cindy Erlandson, proud mother to Devin Constant, mother-in-law to Tyler Constant and grandmother to Easton Tyler Constant.  Easton was born on December 22, 2016 and shares his birthday with his proud father Tyler.  He was born at a healthy weight of 8lbs 7ozs and was sent home from the hospital within the normal 2 day timeframe.  Devin and Tyler were overjoyed that they were able to bring home a beautiful, healthy, good natured little boy.  When he was 5 days old, Easton had his first check up.  The doctor said he was perfect.    Two days later, things changed suddenly.Here is what happened in Devin's words:Thursday morning our little man came down with a high temp and wasn't acting like himself. We brought him to the ER to be checked out, all while thinking this was going to be an expensive trip to just be told he had a cold. When we got there he had a series of tests done and his temp kept climbing and wouldn't come down with Tylenol. I could tell he was getting worse and he stopped eating. Easton and I were air lifted to Sanford in Sioux Falls, when we landed his temp was at ...104°. After more tests were done it was confirmed he has bacterial meningitis. That day was the hardest day of both of our lives. Friday, Easton was doing much better and we have realized he is such a fighter! His temp was going down and he is starting to eat again. Our doctor expects him to make a full recovery but he will remain in the NICU for at least the next 3 weeks for antibiotic therapy. We are so blessed to have caught this early and that he will be okay. Please keep our little family in your prayers!Easton is feeling better each day, and thankfully, his parents are are no longer consumed with fear of losing him.  He is responding well to treatments and is expected to go back home in about 3 weeks if all goes well.  There are possibilities of hearing loss and developmental and speech delays or disabilities as side effects of the medications and meningitis, so please continue to pray for him.Devin and Tyler were financially prepared for the birth of their first child.  They were not prepared for the air lift and 3 plus weeks of hospital stay and treatment.  Because the treatment is taking place in 2 separate years, it increases their out of pocket expenses.  After checking with the insurance company, they estimated out of pocket costs to be around $10,000.  I believe that with various family members support, we can help them cover about half of the costs. My hope is that Devin and Tyler would have another chance at joyously bringing their new baby home.  After this scare, these new parents may be more worried than most about their baby's health.  But, other than that, I hope their biggest concerns will be lack of sleep and whose turn is it the change the diaper, rather than having to worry about a new financial obligation and how to pay for it.I am thankful to all who have prayed for Easton's health, there were a couple of miracles that happened that led to him getting the prompt and correct treatment that led to his recovery.  We feel truly blessed.",https://images.gofundme.com/v9YxMx1QNYQlrT0UGpSLOd5b9Rw=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_fb_1483389274.3621_funds.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_1483390669.8479_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_1483390623.338_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145132_1483394108.0292_funddescription.jpg']",3,"Created January 2, 2017",Cindy Matzdorff Erlandson is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Devin Constant.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,720 raised of $5,000 goal"

Doctors believe the cancer is exclusive to his brain.Following his release from the hospital, he will be moved to St. Lukes rehab facility in Spokane for a few weeks, and the process after that will be radiation and chemotherapy.  The path will be long and difficult, and expensive, which is why we are posting this GoFundMe account.  He does have Medical coverage, but there are expenses that will not be covered; there will be hotel and travel expenses for Haley, as well as some lost wages, that she will need help with as well.  Those that know Bill, know that he is proud and if he could stop this, he would, but sometimes a helping hand is what is needed.  If you do not feel comfortable donating through this process, but you'd like to help, there is an account set up at Coulee Dam Federal Credit Union.  The account is set up under Darleen Fitzhugh S2 - the S2 designates it is for Bill Galbraith Donations.  You can go to any one of the branches and make a deposit, or if you want to write a check, you can make it out to Darleen Fitzhugh, with Bill's name in the memo line.  Mail your check to:  CDFCU, PO Box  216, Coulee Dam, WA 99116.  With all our hearts, we thank you for any and all donations.",https://images.gofundme.com/Q2w7hEnLjhGpAFc6gzQdihNWm0g=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145170_1483389806.5472.jpg,[],0,"Created January 4, 2017",Tammy Fitzhugh Spicer is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Haley Galbraith.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$4,570 raised of $5,000 goal"

It's quite frustrating to go back and forth with medical professionals and receive no answers as to why the problem is happening. So being able to communicate to you all through social media has been a lifesaver for keeping my spirits up and distracted from the pain I'm in.Long story short I have an infection in my scrotum that requires serious antibiotics and complete bed rest for about a week and a half. Also basically a scrotum bra to keep my testicles from hanging low and increasing the risk of spreading the infection. Glamorous right? All caused from a probable UTI and (get this) wearing cock rings too small for long periods of time. On top of that my kidneys are in bad shape. My use of steroids combined with prep and not drinking enough water have basically forced my kidneys to make an SOS call. This of course, could've been prevented had I been smarter and taken better care of myself. I take full responsibility for that and it has been quite the wake up call.In September I was diagnosed with non hotchkins lymphoma type A. I've kept it kind of a secret because A. I don't want pity and B. It sounds worse than it is. Yes I have a type of cancer but it has about a 90% survival rate if caught and treated quickly. Thankfully it was caught before any real dyer concerns could happen. So please don't think I'm dying or anything of the sort. It will take much more than that to get rid of me. Unfortunately I haven't been being the most responsible when it comes to dealing with the news regardless of how mild the doctors tell me it is. When you're 29 and you hear you have cancer of ANY kind it does feel a bit hopeless and I've slipped into depression and made not so great decisions to numb or forget the possibilities of the worse case scenario. Even though Ive always been a step behind my entire life, I feel I'm ahead of the game this time and choose to start dealing with it head on instead of ignoring it so that I dont make it worse and epidsodes like this week are no more common as a scene without me moaning. All that being said, I'm very lucky to have a few friends in the medical profession who have given me care under the table but after this episode it is clear that I have to get serious about getting this issue under control so that I can continue on having a normal life. I have medical which is basically poor people's insurance but I've been advised by my doctor and by the beautiful bills I've received, even for the minor treatments I've gotten that it basically covers nothing for a condition of this sort. So I'm changing my healthcare plan to one that will cover my condition and the regular treatments required for the months to come so that I can come out of it healthy and not in debtAll insurances have a deductible that must be paid before the policy will cover any treatment. I have chosen a pricier plan when it comes to that but hoping that after the deductible is taken care of my medication and anything required to send this cancer packing will be of no cost to me. So after the deductible and the price rate of the medications I've just recieved I'm hoping to raise about $10,000 so that I can go these next 6months with the best possible care and not have to stress about being able to afford it. Any donation would be greatly appreciated no matter how small. We all need help sometimes and I'm no longer too proud to admit this is a time I do myself. If I'm able to raise more than the funds I need I will donate the remainder to a charity involving homeless gay youth. We as community and an industry need to take care of each other and make the year 2017 the year we finally put petty shit aside and stick up for one another and have each other's backs!I love you all very much and I thank you for being you and keeping the best medicine alive.Humor and laughter I'm not going anywhere and will continue to work as much as I can. I'm just asking for help to keep me able to do so.All my love to you all",https://images.gofundme.com/ATq-efBqroROXlgSwMZyE0u4U_o=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145254_1483389502.0445.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Micah Brandt is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,745 raised of $10,000 goal"
https://www.gofundme.com/f/sunusracing,Stillbirth Awareness Campaign,"During the summer of 2017, SUNUS Ocean Racing with its crew; TV personality and seasoned adventurer Ben Fogle & record holding powerboat racer Tom Montgomery-Swan will attempt to break the world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the British Isles by sea in a small 32ft long racing boat. Both men have suffered the loss of a child, born still at full term and both along with 20 other team members want their event to be a national platform, raising awareness for this often not spoken about tragedy. Many suffer in silence and the team want to break the mold and in a small way offer support to effected families across the country. Many hospitals across the UK are not equipped to offer real support and care for Stillbirth pregnancies. Much of the equipment created to aid post birth care are not funded by the already stretched National Health Service. Through our activities we would like to do what we can to see more hospitals equipped with vital technology to help those having to go through such an ordeal. From our own personal experiences there are many practical things that can be done to help provide hospitals with better equipment and support products. In the UK babies are born still 15 times a day, often the fantastic charities that provide support are investing million's in vital research to stop stillbirth for good, however we feel we can have an instant, reactionary impact with support equipment that can have a positive impact on families NOW rather than in years to come. Many mum's have to give birth to their still babies on wards full of healthy pregnancies, rather than in their own dedicated rooms, where in privacy they can be given the time to mourn and receive the support they desperately need. Many are left feeling alone, as if they let their children down, that this is more unique than they realise. We plan to use our national events and marine motorsport to help break the silence on this taboo subject, offering a voice for these individuals and point affected ones to the charities experienced in providing care, outside of the support equipment we would like to fund with your help. The Event:This 2000 mile epic challenge will truly test the team as they battle some of the worlds toughest seas and the UK's remotest coastlines, non stop to break the current record of 73 hours. This will challenge the crew to power through no sleep or rest while at the wheel of their record breaking boat, equivalent to 3 Les Mans 24hr car races back-to-back. The team will need to be at the peak of their physical and mental abilities as they master night navigation and sea survival skills as they skipper their vessel around our beautiful but sometimes unforgiving coastline. The route will include mainland Britain, Ireland and remote islands, a total distance of just over 2000 miles, with a goal record time of 50 hours. With an experienced media team behind them, It is planned that as the team travel around the UK, the record attempt will attract national and local press, further promoting our cause and awareness program.The boat represents the very latest in marine design, using the most fuel efficient and emission friendly performance engines. The boat too incorporates the well proven racing hull which lowers fuel consumption by effective hydrodynamic design. We will also be using the trip to work on our green technology development, testing natural fibre composites from Flax fibres, rather than traditional non eco-friendly synthetic carbon fibres. The teams events throughout the 2017 season along with this circumnavigation world record are funded separately by the team's commercial partners who have supported the awareness program. The funds raised within this campaign will go to fund our Stillbirth Awareness Campaign. The team has already used 2016 to create awareness for Stillbirth. During this time the boat was featured on Amazon Prime's hit TV show; The Grand Tour. The boat was on show at the UK's largest boat show, on show to over 200,000 people. During the normal racing events of the team, the boat won 2 out of 3 events and broke two national speed records, attracting over 40,000 visitors a week to the teams website and social platforms. More visitors than any other UK racing team, superb news for our awareness campaign. Our plan is only to build upon this foundation for 2017 and reach more people with our awareness program.How the funds raised within this campaign will be spent.The more our campaign is supported, the more we can do for effected families, although you may not be able to join us on the boat, even if it be a pound, every penny helps and can change a horrific situation for a family near you. SUNUS Ocean Racing have worked with partners to organise various items for Stillbirth support. From working with Midwives to equip stillbirth delivery rooms to securing trade deals on equipment, making donations go further. Specifically funds raised will go towards purchasing vital cooling Moses baskets, technology which means parents do not have to send their newborn baby to the mortuary, it allows you time to digest what has happened, get to know your child and invite loved ones to visit you. These are presented in very normal nursery style baskets and are less raw then traditional stainless medical trolleys, taking your baby away to the mortuary. SOR Baby Boxes are presented in quality boxes that can be kept as a memory box. Containing items you might not think off unless you have been through stillbirth and often do not have available when rushed into a hospital situation. These contain premature neutral clothing, a small digital camera as the NHS only provide medical style photos, some would like to have family photos to treasure. Other items include hand and feet casting kits, keepsake teddy's, information on support charities and networks, parenthood bracelet (for mother and baby) and a swaddle blanket. With funding, these boxes will be distributed to labour wards by mothers who have had stillbirth pregnancies and understand the trauma. If funding amounts allow, it is the SOR team goal to use our activities to complete a stillbirth recovery room, decorated and finished for medical delivery of a baby however in a softer ""non-medical"" environment with the privacy parents deserve. Many hospitals do not have this facility, with your help this can be changed. Remaining funds will be used on various stillbirth awareness events and activities. Donors will be kept up to date on the teams activities, allowing you to feel really part of the team. We thank you for your support and hope you can join our journey to making a change for good, through a national event which pushes us harder than ever before.See the boat at this years London Boat Show (6th-15th January) where we will be promoting the boats activities and stillbirth awareness program.",https://images.gofundme.com/GkVwgCvWhWo8khLf4TyBCWuMt3Q=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17145306_1483390376.8764.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Tom Montgomery-Swan is organizing this fundraiser.,"Sports, Teams & Clubs","£5,145 raised of £20,000 goal"

He has provided the opportunity for me to be a part of a youth mission team going to Nicaragua. I’ll be traveling with others from Grace United Methodist Church in Cape Coral, FL, leaving on May 27th and returning on June 3rd. Our team will spend a week serving a community in Esteli, Nicaragua. We will share the Gospel of Jesus with children, youth, and young adults, through our words and deeds. I have been a member of Grace United Methodist Church over the past 9 years and I have felt the calling of ministry this past year. I have been meeting and mentoring with our youth pastors to discuss the calling my heart has felt from the Lord. I truly find joy in serving others. I have actively served at many events over the years such as, Grace Place kids, Celebrate Recovery kids, Respite, Vacation Bible School, Shoes of Hope, and J. Colin English School family outreach. I have never been on a mission trip and I feel as though this will be the next step forward in the growth of my ever-strengthening faith in God.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/togo-africa-midwifery-intensive,"Togo, Africa Midwifery Intensive","DELIVER MORE THAN JUST THE GOOD NEWS...IN TOGO, AFRICA      APRIL 20 - JUNE 5, 2017A few years ago, on a mission trip to Ghana, Africa, two women in the village gave birth during the night alone in their huts. The next morning, I was amazed to see both of them at the well at separate times, with their newborns, bending and lifting in order to fill the large containers on top of their heads. My naïve awe of their strength quickly turned into shock and heartbreak when, in discussion with my local friend, I found out that the maternal mortality rate in that part of the country is 50%! It seemed beyond comprehension that in such a joyous occasion, rather than the choices of an ‘ideal’ birth plan, these women were dealing with life and death and only 1 of every 2 would survive. There had to be a better model of care and education that would drastically improve this statistic that could include attention to well-woman, maternity, postpartum support, and infant care all while honoring their cultural distinctions. Knowing that Ghana was likely not unique in this awful statistic, I began crying out to the Lord from the depths of my heart that day. Hoping for a solution to the problem, I felt a clear tug on my heart to become part of the birth story for many, no matter what that might mean for me personally. It was certainly not the solution that I was looking for and since have often wished that there were a different one. However, the cry of my heart persists as does my desire to draw near to those that deserve better. That day still remains so poignant to me and drives me forth as the moment that led me to and keeps me focused on the path of midwifery.

Upon my return, he was quick to share this with me. Given what I just told you, you can probably imagine all of the things going through my heart and mind! Not surprisingly, here we are pursuing an offer that I received to be a part of critical clinical experience in Togo, Africa. This is the same birth center that God worked out for me to visit just days before I left for our trip. The offer is to travel to Togo from April 20 -June 5, 2017 as a family so that I can be 1 of 6 incredibly blessed students who will get intimate hands-on training in a birth center. Beautiful Mom and babe in Kenya, AfricaThe next few months will be spent buying tickets, getting visas, making arrangements on the Togo YWAM base to set up our temporary residence, planning to have help at the farm while we’re away, and, most importantly, staying alert to Abba’s voice. This opportunity in Togo makes our dream, about helping to launch a birth center in Kenya, seem possible and within reach now. What a difference a little time makes while we wait on the Lord to take care of all of the details.

It has effected not only his heart, but his shoulder and all the way down to his fingers. Because of his condition,  his left arm was three times the size of his right arm.  The swelling and pain became so intense, that Doctors decided to amputate his left arm. From the first surgery until the amputation at Christmas 2016, it has been an enormous financial burden on his family.   Because he still has fistulas in his left shoulder, the type of prosthetis will need to be unique to meet his needs.Doctors predict that most all of the swelling of the surgery will be gone by the end ofMarch 2017, and he can get ""fitted"" for a prosthetic arm.  His family is  in desperate financial need to help Bill get his new arm so that he has the ability to continue working to provide for his family.   He and his family wish to thank you so much for your compassion, prayers and donations.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/masons-heart-fund,Mason's Heart Fund,"Hi everyone, this is my amazing grandson Mason Hirschfield and he is the son of my son Chris and his wife Brittany. Mason was born with a Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) which was recently discovered. He was diagnosed with a Partial Atrioventricular Canal Defect (AVCD/AVSD), which means he has a large Primum Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) and a cleft mitral valve. Essentially that is a large hole between the top chambers of his heart and his mitral valve didn’t form completely. We are so blessed that his new pediatrician heard his murmur and referred him to Sibley Heart Center Cardiology where Dr. Harden diagnosed the defect. In January 2017 he will have open heart surgery to repair the defects in his little heart. His surgeon will put a patch over the hole and stitch his valve. This will allow his oxygen rich blood to go out to his body where it belongs instead of flowing back in his heart. He will be at CHOA Egleston in Atlanta, GA for about a week after surgery until he gets strong enough to go home. I would also like to tell everyone a little about CHDs. CHDs effect nearly 1% of all births per year in the US. About every 15 minutes another baby is born with a CHD. AVSDs are just one kind and are only about 5% of all CHDs. In 2005, for a privately insured population in the Unites States, the estimated medical care costs for an average infant with any CHD was about $23,000, and costs were higher for infants with a severe CHD (this is a statistic from 2005 prior to the skyrocketing medical costs that our country has experienced in the past decade). We're asking for help in two ways:-PRAY for steady hands for the surgeon and a successful surgery for Mason's heart. -PRAY for Mason to be strong and pray for his family to be courageous. If anyone would like to donate to a fund it would help his parents pay for some of the medical bills and expenses incurred to mend his heart back to a healthy heart. Nothing is too big or too small and your prayers are deeply appreciated!

We have seen the image of the little girl holding her hands up to the photographer because she thought he was holding a gun... This is due to the normality of the situation in Syria. We have all seen the young boy sitting in the ambulance in a state of shock covered in rubble... Yet we don’t realise the impact this is having on those children mentally.    I recently attended a conference where Muntada Aid had made an appeal. They discussed the psychological damage to the people of Syria specifically the children. Children often draw images depicting things they have seen. They are becoming desensitised to violence because of what they have seen so frequently. 3-year old children should be drawing images of nature, their family playing and happy times... But a 3-year old in Syria draws bombs dropping on houses, bullets striking civilians... HOW IS THIS NORMAL?  The most common cause of death amongst soldiers is actually soldiers who suffer with PTSD committing suicide due to the trauma of war, so imagine how the children of Syria are feeling.   Imagine a 5-year old girl witnessing her mother raped and her father brutally murdered, - only a few examples of the atrocities occurring in Syria. These unfortunate events are leaving the children of Syria with deep psychological scars.  We can only hope that one day Syria will be a beautiful nation again, but how can Syria rebuild itself when these children who will one day lead Syria are so disturbed by the violence they have witnessed over the years?  Our leaders have failed to protect these children from the realities of war, but we have an opportunity to give them a better future. It is never too late help those innocent souls.   The money that I raise will be going to Muntada Aid, to enable them to give the people of Syria the psychological help that they so desperately need.  My brothers & sisters we are all aware that giving in charity is a pillar of Islam. It is part of obedience and worship to Allah. The Prophet PBUH said when engaging in war we are not to harm the children. It would be wrong for us to turn away from them, as we have a duty to do our best to ensure that we do the best we can to help them in whatever manner we can.  The Prophet PBUH said “The believers shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity” – Al-Tirmidhi Hadith 604  Thank you for taking the time to read this, May Allah bless you always.",https://images.gofundme.com/QWUbBIFd9jmqWsjarzXDRudoJmM=/640x480/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NFAGUTUUei4/0.jpg,[],0,"Created February 11, 2017",Lamis Kola is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","£2,530 raised of £2,500 goal"

He's also a proud man with a strong work ethic and the ingrained belief that one should always make it with your own effort, so it's very difficult for him to ask for help. But he is struggling and starting to lose hope. In addition to other health issues, he has a progressively worsening serious heart condition and will be having a VAD installed, and may utlimately end up having a heart transplant. This is a harsh reality for a man only in his 50's. In addition to the stress and anxiety of dealing with the uncertainties concerning his health, he is now hit with the mounting financial strain of not having been able to work for 2+ months.  Even if he is able to return  to work part time -- which he is trying to do but it is uncertain whether physically he will be able to do so because of his health conditions -- it won't be enough.  Although Jim has begun the process for a disability claim, approval is months away at best, and longer at worst.  In the meantime he needs to stay afloat somehow - that's where he needs our help. Jim has tried and keeps getting kicked to the curb to the point it is difficult not to just give up.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/bronzestar,Fallen WWII Hero's Memorial,"The world lost another treasure 2 days ago when the lord ordered SSgt James ""Jim"" Tuminello home to stand watch at the pearly gates. Jim was one of a rapidly decreasing population of World War II heroes and a member of the ""Greatest Generation."" Not only was Jim a Bronze Star recipient, he was also a loving husband to his wife Carmella of over 50 years, an amazing father to 5 beautiful daughters, and a fantastic grandfather to numerous grandkids. Jim was the ultimate definition of a family man, there is nothing he wouldn't do for his family, all the way up until his death he knew nothing but to give, he would literally give you the last dollar out of his wallet if he thought you needed it more than he did.... A few years ago, his body finally started to fail him, dimentia started to set in, he had various other illnesses that limited his mobility, and required constant care from his youngest daughter. However, this did not deter him from still living life to the fullest. He still would find a way to go work out in his garage, cut the grass and even try to fish! I had the opportunity a couple years ago to take him on one last visit to the cemetery to pay a visit to his wife who had passed and his oldest daughter. Little did i know at the time that would be the last.....However, the memories will be cherished forever.  Jim was a smart man and thought ahead and purchased his burial plot right in between his wife and oldest daughter, this way he will forever be with them, and only he would be able to come between them!  Unfortunately, this is where it brings us today...some unfortunate circumstances earlier this year, and one or two unscrupulous people, talked him out of cancelling his pre-paid funeral plans, and refunding the money to him. Leaving him with nothing for that fateful time, which has now come! Taking advantage of a man who is 97 years old, with dimentia is not cool in my book, and leaves us no choice but to ask for donations.   Your donations will go to help cover some basic funeral services, and to give this war hero the honors and send off he so rightly has earned and deserves. All funds will go towards, his transport from Arizona to Newport Beach, CA, embalming, a casket, a small and intimate memorial and ultimately his burial. His wishes are to be buried between his wife and daughter, and NOT to be cremated. I want to make sure that wish is granted, as it was previouslly arranged. Any remaining funds will immediately be donated in his name to a local veterans group such as the VFW, American Legion or Fallen Soldiers Fund.   ""SSgt Tuminello, during the heat of battle deep inside German lines, selflessly, put himself in harms way to protect his squad, in the middle of the road, and taking enemy fire, placed his BAR on the ground and began to open fire on the enemy, single handedly destroying 2 German machine guns nests, providing safe passage for the rest of his squad to advance. For these brave actions SSgt Tuminello is awarded the Bronze Star for heroism."" .......Was the write up from his commander.... We love you Gramps, and someday we will be reunited again.  PLEASE.. Share this with everyone you know, especially if you have connections to Veterens and other WWII veteren groups.  Lets give this hero a proper send off that he rightfully deserves.   Thank you and God Bless!!",https://images.gofundme.com/iBUlWgIsc6zn6Pd-GS9sKWyksKE=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17147288_1483394395.1822.jpg,[],0,"Created January 3, 2017",Dave N Shea is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$1,935 raised of $5,000 goal"

She quickly began chemotherapy, and we were released from the hospital on New Year's Eve. We rung in the New Year as a family at home, taking time together to prepare for the intense year ahead.  There are a variety of types of Lymphoma, and each type has a different course of treatment. For Maisie, we are fortunate that much of her treatment can be done outpatient. Her treatment plan has a high success rate, and we are nothing but optimistic about Maisie's prognosis. However, her treatment plan last approximately one year, with some medications continuing for a few months following treatment. In addition, we will continue to see doctors for years to come both to monitor the progress (or hopefully lack thereof) of the disease, as well as the potential long-term side effects of her chemotherapy and medications. Through all of this, Maisie has been incredible. She brings new meaning to words like ""strong"" and ""brave"". She is an inspiration to us all.  Due to Maisie's condition we will encounter unexpected expenses this year - a variety of medical expenses (insurance, treatment, medication, ER visits, hospital stays, missing days/weeks of work, weekly house cleaning to minimize Maisie's exposure to dust and germs).

On December 26, 2016, Robert was transporting my daughter back to her nursing home following her brief Christmas visit home - the first time she'd been able to come home in over a year.  I was travelling back with her, as I had felt the sudden need to go back with her.  Because of Robert's selfless acts of service, his loyalty to his passengers, his determination to protect us, and his sheer bravery, he saved my daughter's life and my own life during the I-17 freeway shootings in Phoenix.  (See T.V.

We wish to help reduce his economic burden as he heals from his wounds.  I greatly appreciate any financial help you may provide.  Details of our story are shared below. On December 26, 2016, while travelling south on  I-17 near the Thomas Road exit, heading back to the nursing home, traffic suddenly came to a halt.  As traffic veered to the left and the right from the center of the highway, we saw a white vehicle stopped in the middle of the road in front of us, with the trunk and driver door open. We saw a gunman come to the back of the car pointing his gun.  There was one car in front of us between the gunman and our handicapped van.  The gunman began firing gunshots - first aiming towards the car in front of us, which sped away.   The gunman then approached our handicapped van and pointed his gun at our vehicle. He then went to Robert's door and began beating on the window with his gun, yelling for our driver to get out of the vehicle.  We heard Robert emphatically yell back at the gunman: ""No Not This One"" - determined not to let this gunman take over our van.  The gunman then opened Robert's door, pointed his gun up towards Robert’s face and towards the back of the van where my daughter and I were sitting.  The gunman tried to pull Robert out of our van - trying to carjack our vehicle.  Robert quickly grabbed the gun with both hands, pulling it towards him and downward, so that he would not be shot in the head and be left unable to drive and so that we would not be shot.  While fighting off this gunman, Robert was shot and a bullet pierced a hole in his hand.   The gunman tried again to get into our vehicle to carjack it.  Although severely injured from the gunshot wound, Robert bravely found a way to push the gunman away.   (It was impossible for me to get my disabled daughter out of her wheelchair and onto the floor before the shooting began, so we could only sit and pray and try to call 911, while Robert fought to keep us safe.)  In yet another act of selfless service, with a hole in his bloody hand from the bullet wound, Robert drove us safely away about 4 miles down the highway. I had him pull over, asked to see his wound, which he was hiding to protect me from seeing the horrible sight.  There was blood everywhere.  I insisted that he let me help him wrap his wound, and we all waited in fear and shock for emergency help to arrive.  Despite seeing our lives flash before us, miraculously, our lives were spared that day. We are so thankful to our driver Robert. He was a real hero. He was not afraid to stand up to the gunman, and he put our safety ahead of his own.  Robert refused to let the gunman take control of our van because, as he told me, he knew that we were in the vehicle, and he felt he had to protect us and return us safely to my daughter's nursing home.  Robert was not about to turn us over to an armed gunman. We later learned that police had a shootout with the gunman on the I-17 after Robert drove us safely away from that scene.   Words cannot describe the horror of this incident, which has etched a place in our hearts and minds forever.  But what else is etched in our hearts and minds forever, are Robert's acts of heroism and selfless acts of service to me and to my daughter that day.  We are grateful for the miracles that saved our lives on December 26th - especially for Robert's quick and perfect actions, with very little time to think before he had to react to a real life and death situation. He did everything a true hero would do.  Thank you Robert!   Please help us give back to this true American Hero, so that he can receive financial help during his time of recovery.   His protection of me and my special daughter will never be forgotten.  I will sincerely appreciate any financial assistance you can donate to Robert, who protected not only me, but our daughter, who is one very special angel, as described below.   Tiffany joined our family in 1994 as a 2 year-old foster child.  At her tender young age, she had already suffered too much.  We were able to adopt her at age 4, and we have been blessed to be her parents and to work diligently to give her a better life, despite the impact upon her of her biological parents' poor choices.   Sadly, at 21 years of age, Tiffany was stricken with a severe case of mono, along with the onset of numerous neurological problems.  She has been in and out of hospitals and nursing homes for the past 3 years. She cannot stand or walk and has a very long list of health problems that require her to be cared for in a nursing home. She last lived at home on December 22, 2015, three days before Christmas 2015, when she had to be hospitalized again.  Thus, we were never able to have Christmas 2015.  And she has never been able to come home until a year later, on Christmas Eve 2016, when she came for a 2-day visit.   While our visit with her was wonderful, her departure from our home on December 26th, and the need for her to return to the nursing home, was sad for us.  We had family prayer before she left, praying amongst other things, that she would have a safe journey back. As the time came for her to get into the van with Robert to return to her nursing home, I was strongly inspired that I needed to go with her, and I did.  Now I know why. The trauma upon her would have much worse had she been alone in the back of that van during that horrific crime. I am her legal guardian, advocate and protector, and she and I are thankful I was there that day. Despite having much of the life she knew stripped away from her at the young age of 21, and despite being confined to a nursing home, Tiffany has served as a special friend to many - both young and old alike, who have ended up in her nursing homes. She has selflessly served so many disabled patients. She has comforted and uplifted many individuals in her nursing homes. She has put smiles on so many patients, even those who would not respond to anyone else.  Tiffany has succeeded in getting patients to come out of their rooms and go on outings when they would never do so before. She has blessed and inspired caregivers. She has been called a ""special angel"" by so many who have cared for her or interacted with her. Tiffany has persevered through so much tragedy in her life, and yet she still serves and inspires others.  We are grateful to Robert for saving her life and for allowing her to still be on this earth today to continue blessing the lives of others, regardless of what her own future may bring. Thank you again for your donations to our hero Robert!",https://images.gofundme.com/CeSpVDU1uUx-eX0KjUEaKmgRoS0=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17147746_1483662835.7237.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Regina Pangerl is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Robert Braaksma.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,760 raised of $15,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/joshua-heart,JOSHUA'S HEART,"My name is China Cruz and I would like to take this opportunity to share this heartbreaking story about my son, Joshua Cruz, with all of my friends and family.I am doing so with the hope that none of you will ever have to face what we as a family are now facing.    My son, Joshua is a 34 year old man with a wonderful wife Martha, and two beautiful children, Destiny age 14 and Damien age 10.  This past March, while at work one day, Joshua experienced chest pains and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance.  A multitude of tests and blood work were performed over the next several days to determine the cause of the chest pain.         Ultimately, we were given news we did not want to hear.  Joshua’s heart is weak and functioning at only 43%. This news was heartbreaking and life changing for him and the entire family.  As any family would do, we all came together to support Josh and to give him the strength he needed to endure such news and face reality during this very difficult time.      Since March, he has been in and out of the hospital numerous times and attends doctor visits regularly. During one of these visits, we received even worse news.  Joshua’s heart percentage continues to rapidly decrease and it is now functioning at only 34%. The walls of his heart continue to thicken and cannot pump in a normal rhythm.  It was during one of the more recent visits when things took a turn for the worst.  We received the most devastating news that no mother, wife, or child wants to hear.  We were informed that Joshua has only few years to live.  To say that we were crushed is an understatement.  It was the most heartbreaking and devastating moment of our entire lives that no parent or child should ever have to endure.      The next step was a referral for treatment at Newark Beth Israel Hospital.  The team of doctor’s and nurses there were great and Joshua quickly underwent a catheterization, during which his breathing had stopped.  On August 30th, he was once again admitted to the hospital after feeling as though his symptoms had worsened.  Tests were again performed and it turned out his heart had now dropped to 20%.  This news meant two things- his lifespan had now decreased and he was forced to wear a life vest 24/7.  On October 6th, after four hours of surgery, Joshua received a defibrillator, which sits above his heart and has three stems connecting to the heart. The recovery was long and painful as a result of internal bleeding and an infection.     For those of you who do not know my son, he is a very funny, strong minded, intelligent, caring, loving, individual.  He has devoted his life to being a great father, husband, and provider for his family.  These health issues have placed both emotional and financial burdens on my son and our family, since he is no longer able to work.  His disability checks have long ended, which has resulted in them becoming a single income household.  My daughter in-law is now struggling to balance work, children, the home, and her career, all while caring for a sick husband and meeting the demands of his ongoing appointments.  My granddaughter Destiny will be graduating from 8th grade this coming June and plans for her next educational step have been put on hold because of these unforeseen circumstances. We are asking for any monetary donation, big or small, to assist my son and his family with the surmounting medical bills and daily living expenses.  Any donation would go a long way and be greatly appreciated.  It will help my son focus on gaining the strength he needs for his recovery. I sincerely thank each of you for taking time out of your busy lives to read this and I hope that no family ever has to endure the pain that is now our reality.",https://images.gofundme.com/LQl_fydl1lwUleVnAAg8nIQwVoM=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17148144_1484774168.002.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",China Cruz is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Joshua Cruz.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$3,180 raised of $25,000 goal"

The group is now currently focusing on raising funds through fundraisers, private donations, and grant monies to go towards the costs of improving the dog park to include agility equipment, landscaping, and other amenities within the park. GDOG was founded by local citizen Catherine Mahoney after her dog, Oso’s death in March of 2011, while he was exercising off-leash at Bicentennial Park. Oso was a fun-loving dog who was curious about everything. He was a shiba inu and everyone who knows about shiba inus knows that they are free-spirited and they need the space to run off leash. Catherine has since vowed to create The O-SO Fun Dog Park to prevent further tragedies such as this from happening. GDOG hopes to raise $100,000 in a year through generous donations so that they can finish the final touches to The O-SO Fun Dog Park to make it O-SO wonderful! Together we can bring tremendous improvements to the park. GDOG is O-SO grateful for your consideration to donate to its cause.

We  learned that our mom was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer.  We thought it would end there, however, the cancer has metastasized to other areas of her body to include spine, rib cage, and other bones. (Stage 4) Our mom will be needing both chemotherapy and radiation for treatment along with other procedures like MRI's CT scans, surgeries, prescriptions, etc.Her treatment starts this week and she could use help as soon as possible. Due to the new year that means starting over with a  high deductible along with a high out of pocket max. She's also unable to work which limits her income to pay household bills. Our mother means so much to us and our family. She is our rock, our glue and our biggest supporter. There will never be anyone on God's green earth who will love us like she does. She is the most selfless person  we know-always giving of herself so readily without doubt or question.  Our mother not only means so much to us but she also means so much to so many other people from the teenagers she works with everyday for the last 25 years to the countless strangers she ministers to on a daily basis. (Mom has a prison ministry but if you know her, you know she will minister to anyone. You can be standing in line at a grocery store and she will pray for you!) She has touched so many lives in such a positive, heartfelt way. Somehow, we always hear from the people who have met her and they always have the same thing to say-""I just love your Mom!"" The doctor feels that our mother still has a really good chance at fighting this disease. We want to do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING we can to keep her around for a really long time. We need her here! She has more souls to reach and more lives to bless! She also has many more unnecessary trips to  Bucees (her favorite place other than church) and more Christian Rap songs to write like  her latest hit, ""Get On Up!"" a family favorite! (Yes, she's that awesome!)Our family would be so thankful and appreciative of ANY amount you could give.

In March of 2016 I enrolled in ITT Tech, majoring in computer drafting and design, as a step toward achieving my goal of becoming a civil engineer and hotel designer. Unknown to me at the time, the school was in financial trouble and shut down six months later. All of my finances and college credits were lost. I am in the process of re-applying to a program at University of the Arts in Philadelphia and hope to enroll as early as summer semester of 2017. However, because the school I was enrolled in shut down so abruptly, my loans have been put on hold. I cannot currently apply for the loans I will need to begin taking course this summer. With the grants available to me I will still need to pay a sum of $20,000.00 to start classes at University of the Arts for the summer semester. I am working full time at UPS but my tuition benefits with them will not kick in for another year. Due to the setbacks I encountered over the summer I have been under financial strain - even working full time I have not been able to save money towards tuition as it all goes towards bills and food. It has always been a dream of mine to be a hotel designer. I have worked incredibly hard to get to where I can actually see it becoming a reality. I was raised to work for everything that I receive, and am uncomfortable asking for financial help. But I want to achieve my goals, and to do that I am forced to recognize the limitations of my circumstances and humbly ask for your support. Anything that you can donate would be greatly appreciated.

Our goal around that message is to build a facility from a renovated firehouse that provides a safe place for young men and women to gather and get educated on the dangers of drug and alcohol addiction, in addition to gang prevention and intervention. A place where mentors are there to help navigate teens towards a positive future. A place with information and resources for desperate parents and teens to get answers. We will have scheduled drug, alcohol, and gang education classes, along with parenting classes for families with at risk children. Relentless Rescue will provide academics, arts, and athletics for young people to find a passion far away from negative influences. We want teens to walk through our doors knowing they will be welcomed without judgement into a place where they will always find encouragement and understanding.My name is Juaquin Fabela, president of Relentless Rescue. I am a former gang member and alcoholic who was on a path to nowhere. Seventeen years ago I made a life changing decision to stop the negativity and begin a life serving God through the mentorship I found at an outreach sports center. Since then I have had the honor and opportunity of speaking to over 1 million young people throughout the United States on the consequences of bad decisions. I have received numerous awards for my advocacy dealing with teens and young adults, and now I am ready to build a facility that in turn, will do what was done for me. Through my experiences I've found that it is a whole lot easier to prevent young men and women from becoming addicts and/or gang members, than it is to try and fix the problem once it's already begun. Help us fight for the future of our children...the victory is WORTH the fight!Relentless Rescue will be a place with a fully functioning stage to be used for various performing arts inclusive of- spoken word, musical performances, stage presentations, and theatrics, etc. This space houses an upstairs area that can provide a social setting for group activities or even a quiet place for studying and homework. There will also be an onsite snack and coffee bar with Wifi access throughout the center. The outside area will feature a weight facility, volleyball court, BBQ, and firepit. This will be a cutting edge and safe place for families and friends to spend their time.Relentless Rescue is a proud supporter and partner of organizations such as New Hope Street Ministry who go out faithfully every Saturday rain or shine to feed the homeless, as well as Unseen Youth who travel to Cambodia to fight sex trafficking.We need your support to make all of these life saving dreams become a reality.

It is a copper deficiency disease and because of the inabiity of his body to absorb copper and protect  his brain, multiple seizures become a daily occurence.

However, whatever goes over what the bills end up being are going to go to a memorial fund that will be set up in Juan Colon's name for art.  Here is the story: That's my Kiddo's eye. Sadly, she also had a broken jaw to go with it. On the 29th, when Lindsay and her friend Cynetta were walking to the East room, a group of girls jumped on her friend Cynetta. Lindsay tried to get them off of her, and in turn was attacked. During the melee, she was tripped and her jaw was broken on the curb. Her eye was injured after everyone was separated and while she was holding her jaw, a girl snuck behind her and hit her from behind.She called me, her friends rushing to Northwestern. After my latest interactions with Northwestern emergency I said no way, go to Rush Presbyterian. We met there, kiddo was bleeding from her mouth, swollen jaw, and her eye looking as it does. We literally could not find the entrance there, so we went to Stroger.When was the last time you got in, seen, a CT scan, evaluated, and discharged within 2 hours from an e.r.? Ever? That was a miracle, and I thank the staff there profusely. However, regardless of how excellent they are, I wanted the best surgeon to do the procedure to fix her. And that is when my boy above Oz Schoenstadt reached in. Called his daughter Rose Andron, she got us in to see one of the best docs at Rush Dr. Peter Revenaugh within hours. The day before New Year's, and hours before the memorial for my boy Juan. He looked at the scans that Stroger provided, saw the fractures, and will be putting in two plates tomorrow and wiring her jaw shut for 4-6 weeks, and yet the most upset Lindsay was thinking she was disappointing me was by not being able to bartend my boy Juan's memorial.I thank whatever power there is above that it wasn't worse. That no one had a knife, or a gun. That Lindsay didn't pass out and got beaten worse. That Rose will be watching over my daughter while the doc fixes her. It won't be cheap (anywhere from 10-20 grand) but I want the best for kiddo, and insurance really doesn't cover any of that. So if you want to help, I want to make this offer. Whatever you give you get back, weather it is thru a dinner, or a concert, or babysitting, or gymnastics lessons or audio equipment, you will get your investment back. I'll know how much it is after the surgery.I will know more tomorrow after the surgery, and will post updates, but the important thing is that she will be OK, and she has a wolverine like healing factor, and that she did the right thing trying to protect her friend. I'm proud of her. She gets wired shut tomorrow for 4-6 weeks, but please text her and send her well wishes.

After having a very hard labor and being scared to death that me or my baby might not survive I was diagnosed a week later with a rare heart condition called peripartum cardiomyopathy. I never in my life expected that I would be diagnosed with a rare heart condition keeping me from returning to work. This has been very devastating news to me but I'm trying to fight it. Basically what all the fancy words mean is that the left part of my heart is only working at 15% and so it's very hard for me to do things that normal people my age due including just carrying my baby! It sort of feels like I'm breathing through Swiss cheese lungs.. if you have any questions I'd be glad to give you more info on my condition. Since the diagnosis: I've Lost my job (I am not able to perform the duties)I have lost my medical coverage(which I had through my job) I can not get any assistance because unbeknownst to me the medical coverage that I was paying for didn't include temporary disability. My husband lost his job in October and continues to search for work day after day. I've been on countless meds but my heart has not really improved in the last 5 months.This is only a small list of the trials I have been facing, and through it all I have been working as much as I can babysitting, which is still very hard on me but I have no other choice and it is not enough to cover everything. It kills me to not be able to do what I am used to because I have worked hard my entire life, and I am at the point where I need to ask for help because at this time I feel time I have no other alternatives. The medical bills are going to start piling up. Not to mention the costs of having a new baby and he needs basic necessities. I need to be able to travel to doctors appointments and pay for the appointments and make sure that my baby is cared for. My latest doctor told me that I may need a heart transplant and I do not know how I will be able to have that happen without medical insurance. I am seeing a peripartum cardiomyopathy specialist this month, and I hope he has better news for me. If anyone could help me with these costs I will be so grateful for your kindness and generosity and once I beat this awful condition I will be sure to pay it forward.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/will-seawright-memorial,Will Seawright Memorial,"On January 6, 2013, we lost a friend, a brother, a son, an uncle, and an Ole Miss Rebel.  William “Will” J. Seawright did not have to work hard to make friends.  He was a young man who carried a smile that was contagious.  If you were with Will you were going to be happy regardless of whether you grew up with Will in Pontotoc, Mississippi, were Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers, befriended Will at Ole Miss, bonded with him in Dallas, Texas, or met him in Jackson, Mississippi. He always helped create a memory, and to return the favor it is our hope to make his memory everlasting.On the weekend of May 20, 2017, a group of Will’s fraternity brothers are coming together to celebrate 20 years of friendship.  Although he will not be able to be with us physically, he will certainly be there with us in spirit.  With the support of friends and family, in an effort to remember Will at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house in Oxford, we have set a goal to raise $15,000.These funds will be used to purchase new benches for the front porch with a marker in Will’s memory.  In addition, the remaining funds will be used as a gift to the Ole Miss Alumni Association for purposes of a marker in Will’s memory on the Ole Miss Campus- as a Life Member of the Ole Miss Alumni Associate and #1 Ole Miss Rebel Fan!Please help us meet our goal to remember Will.  We know that Will would be humbled to know his name will be permanent on a place he loved so dearly at The University of Mississippi.  Thank you and God Bless.",https://images.gofundme.com/Zk0Hb7yTFdtTDDFMmiglLH3GuWQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1483401277.2495.jpg,"['https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068464.1072_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068496.8995_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068530.2944_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068606.664_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068141.5708_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068160.4863_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067919.0184_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067941.718_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067964.4077_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067991.4717_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068010.5074_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068032.1148_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068053.0924_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496068070.3538_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067852.5335_funddescription.jpg', 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17149930_1496067866.4975_funddescription.jpg']",16,"Created January 2, 2017",Garnet Reynolds is organizing this fundraiser.,Funerals & Memorials,"$9,765 raised"

He has a wonderful wife and family that he loves with his whole being, a job he has mastered, and an outlook on life that, well, we should all have.Think of cancer. It's miserable. It disrupts family as it seems that is it's only job; it pulls life out of too many.This past October, Bob had an appointment with his primary doctor, Dr. Schafer at IHS. He went in for nothing more than a mere check-up for his back, shoulders and something in his eye. After his screening, Dr. Schafer ordered some tests. A PSA blood test revealed Bob’s levels were at 7.5 (at his age, they should be no higher than 2.5), thus Bob was referred to Dr. Sawchuck, a urology specialist at Sanford in Fargo. At his first Sanford appointment, they checked his PSA levels again; the results prompted a biopsy of his prostrate, which took place on October 31st. Just prior to departing for the Mahnomen Indians football game in the Fargodome on November 3rd, Bob and Jackie received the news of the biopsy results: cancer in two spots. At a consult with Dr. Sawchuck on November 17th, surgery to remove Bob’s prostrate was recommended, due to his age, the stage of the cancer and other factors. This recommendation was confirmed by a urology specialist at the Mayo Clinic on December 7th. Due to the recovery time needed after the biopsy, surgery wasn't scheduled until Tuesday, January 17th. Post surgery recovery will be several weeks.Bob, Jackie, Bobby and Gabe will leave on Sunday, January 15th. Dusty, Madi and Desiree will also go, but as work allows. They will need to be in Rochester for the week; even after discharge, it is not recommended that Bob make the long car trip home for at least a day or so.Go back to Bob. He's the definition of happy and go-lucky. His smile is contagious. His generosity is endless. Many know him for his mad (meat) smoking skills. Others know Bob for his wood work and building skills. Others for his love - love of family, love of sports (especially those his boys play), love of fishing and hunting, and of course for living another day of adventure (he is, after all, Jackie’s adult child).This fund has been set-up to help Bob, Jackie and kids for traveling expenses (lodging, food, gas and any miscellaneous expenses that pop up), as well as loss of time and wages from Jackie’s job.Life is an adventure, and this is just a bump in the road of Bob’s adventure. Think of him and his family. Say a prayer, or many. Donate what you can, because anything will help. Think of Bob. He’s happy. He has a wonderful wife and family he loves with his whole being. And he’s going to beat cancer.(Bob and Jackie’s children and grandchildren thank everyone in advance. Prayers, positive messages and any donations means so much. Living in a community that stands together is priceless. And although it was hard for Bob to agree to a GoFundMe page, their kids don't want Jackie and Bob to worry about anything other than beating cancer, ensuring many more years of family, love and adventure. Also, we all want to thank those who are watching over Bob and Jackie’s house and volunteering in so many other ways.)",https://images.gofundme.com/siUnfy15qlayRcyffxOk9lXD_Oc=/640x480/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/17150142_14834037810_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Joan LaVoy is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jackie Bjorge.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$5,295 raised of $4,000 goal"

However it's also expensive, and  crucial to the educational path I'd like to be on. The school is a Mortuary Archaeology school based in Poland , and as somebody who wants to have a career in Forensic Anthropology, work in the field is crucial- not only for being successful- but also for being able to become a certified member of the ABFA (American Board of Forensic Anthropology).  As of now, I have gathered enough funds to pay the cost of the field school, but it doesn't leave me with much. Certainly not enough for a plane ticket, or supplies for the trip. If any of you could donate or help, it would mean a huge amount to me- as this trip is an amazing opportunity for me, and also! is educationally beneficial!

He is 6' tall and weighs approximately 115 pounds. Gastroparesis is a disease that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Food sits in his stomach and starts rotting. When this happens, He gets horrible stinky and very painful burps and then he starts throwing up. There is no cure for this horrible disease. Every day, he throws up multiple times. He had been in and out of hospitals and ER departments for years. They can't or won't do anything for him anymore except give him an iv for fluids and medicate him. They even release him if he is still throwing up, saying they can't do anything more for him. When he gets home from these visits, it takes him days to get all the meds out of his system and then he is back to throwing up again. It is a never ending cycle. He had stopped going to ER's as it is just too hard on him and his body. Instead he stays at home in bed when he has a bad GP episode and works through it himself. These episodes usually last anywhere from 4-7 days at a time. It breaks my heart to see my son so sick and in so much pain all the time. I can't keep a job as when he is sick, I need to be home to take care of him. He is also a type 1 Diabetic since 2004 and it is crucial that he keep his sugar levels as low as possible. This is extremely difficult to do when he is throwing up all the time. The times when he can eat a little, he will take insulin for what he eats, but then he throws up his food and then his sugars get all out of whack!Also due to his constant throwing up, his teeth are rotting and falling out. He needs extensive dental work done that we can't afford. I have created this campaign for my son to request help for my son to get to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota as we have been told they have the best GI department.   There is also a doctor/surgeon in Indiana that does stomach removal. Also need help with money for extensive dental work before his teeth all fall out. Please note that I, Leslie Wessels, Gregs Mom,  created this campaign for my son, Gregory Wessels and that I maintain and manage this campaign for him.  I will withdraw the funds received for Gregs medical needs, as needed.  Thank you for reading our story and if you can, please help my son with a donation.  We both would appreciate it very much!Thank you,Leslie (Greg's Mom)",https://images.gofundme.com/CK7_ykVBBzayYnaa6m1nBtGttUg=/960x960/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17150220_1502317054.2432.jpg,[],0,"Created March 13, 2017",Leslie Wessels is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,620 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ashleyyogainstructor,Help Ashley Become A Yoga Instructor,"Hello all! If you've found yourself to this page, then it's probably no surprise to you that I'm passionate about weight loss, exercise, yoga, and all around physical fitness.You may already know my story, but if not, let me give you a brief summary. Almost 4 years ago, I was told by my doctors that if I didn't lose weight that I would soon be diagnosed with diabetes, would have to remain on high blood pressure medication for my entire life, would continue to struggle with asthma, and wouldn't be able to have children. I truly felt like my quality of life was slim to none. I was slowly killing myself and was very quickly losing my entire future. Something inside of me finally WOKE UP. I joined Weight Watchers and over the course of 2 years lost 147 pounds naturally. All by eating right and exercising. I have maintained my weight loss since then. Over the past year and a half, I've become more and more passionate about yoga and fitness in general. So passionate, actually, that I knew during my weight loss that I would eventually want to invest in a career in the fitness/health field. I have two goals: to become a personal trainer and a yoga instructor. Today, I'd like to talk about the latter goal. I'm tired of working a basic 9-5 job that simply ""pays the bills"". I want a career that fuels my soul, challenges my body, and encourages/betters others.  I want to become a yoga instructor to show others the potential their body holds. If someone would have told me 4 years ago that I would one day be physically healthy, I don't know if I would have believe them.

She would later take on the name Kathryn Dalton Magana after marrying Larry Magana whom she loved a lot. She lived a full life in her short 54 years. She is the baby of four siblings; Hugh, Dorothy, and Tommy. At the age of 9 she lost her mother to cancer. Then at the age of 15 she lost her father to heart complications. As a teenager she had her siblings to keep her going. She learned how to be an adult early. No matter what life dealt her she overcame. Most of all she loved every person she met. Kathy helped anyone that needed it. She opened her home to all who did not have one. No one was turned away. Kathy was loving until then end. She went to sleep on January 2, 2017 at 1:13PM. As we now prepare for her to be laid to rest the cost is extremely high. We have set a goal that would cover the expenses. This includes the funeral ceremony in Austin, TX. The travel expense to lay her to rest in Pearland, TX. The thing that means the most to the family is she is laid to rest with her parents and grandparents in Pearland. Whatever you can give will bless the family and lift some of the burden. Please know the family would love to continue to receive your thoughts and prayers. It means the world to us. Thank you for your time and consideration. With Love,Larry, Kristy, Brandie, Joseph, & Family*Joseph Astran, Kathy's son, will be handling the funds to insure all cost are covered.

Specifically she, and Doug's kids, will be using these finances to pay for:-cremation-venue rental for the Illinois memorial-any and all supplies needed to publicize the memorials in Illinois, Texas & California-any unexpected autopsy and medical bills-airfare for her and Doug's children to attend the memorials-grief counseling & management for her and Doug's childrenWe were unsure of what the monetary goal for Doug's Go Fund Me should be because so many details of possible medical expenses are still up in the air. So, if a $10,000 goal seems like too much, rest assured that all donations will go towards Doug's funeral arrangements with any surplus going to his kids. All expenses will be itemized on this page so donors will be aware of where the funds were finally allocated. These funds will be needed fairly soon as Bun E. and Doug's kids have already started planning the Memorial. Bun E. will be in charge of all of the final expenses.So, I just want to thank all donors in advance for your kindness in helping out Bun E. and the kids. The unexpected nature of his death has made this an extremely hard and emotional time for all of them. Doug was one of the most generous people I know and, I know he'd be heartbroken if he knew his passing had financially burdened his loved ones. He, like me, might have figured he was invincible--that 53 was young or that he'd still be kicking it at 80. Who needs to plan for dying? Pfffttt.........We'll all miss you Doug.

We need another $21,000 to make this project a success and a reality.Lemosho Primary School is located to the west of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The school has a tremendous need for renovation to support the learning and education of the children the school serves. Julius Mtongore (best known as Whitey) is a professional Tanzanian mountain guide with over 12 years of experience leading expeditions on Kilimanjaro. He is also one of the premier mountain guides for Ahsante Tours, a local family owned tour company based in Kilimanjaro. Julius has been leading fundraising expeditions for overseas charities for thousands of clients around the world.This month he will be reaching beyond the borders of Tanzania to conquer another one of the world's ""7 summits"" to raise money for the Lemosho Primary School. Whitey plans to use this opportunity to promote awareness of the renovation of the school. This will be an incredible journey for ""Whitey"" as he will be one of only a few Tanzanians to ever climb this mountain.The goals for this campaign is to raise $50,000 USD. The school has 1,079 students and only 7 classrooms. The money will be spent to rebuild 2 of the classrooms. The plan is to re-build the 2 classrooms and if possible get a 3rd classroom built. We plan to fundraise over the next 2 months so that construction starts in March.Generations of children will benefit from this project because we hope that Whitey’s journey will help inspire more Tanzanian’s to make a difference.

Most, if not all her life, she has lived for her family...but as of November she has had to turn the attention on herself when she was diagnosed with stage two cervical cancer. But let’s just back up for a second. This is the mother who is caring and nurturing. Who is a problem solver and the person to go to for a quick laugh and a more lengthy hug. The one who always makes time for anyone, no matter their age. Her children are proof of that.She’s determined and driven. She volunteered at the high school the twins attend and cooked meals for their football programs. She was one of many who cheered on the sidelines of so many BLHS football games, all the while students coming by to give her hugs or high fives. She is a person who is easily loved.She decided to make the monumental decision to go back to school in her thirties for elementary education and has just recently started her profession as a teacher. Her school kids adore her and {we’re pretty certain!} she feels the same about them. She has most certainly found her groove at Lafayette, but due to the cancer treatment, she will not be able to return to teaching until at least April.Late December, her cervical cancer was upgraded to stage three as it had spread to the lymph system.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/allie-colt-brain-cancer-fund,Allie T Colt Brain Cancer Fund,"I'm so very sorry and truly embarrassed that I have to ask my friends, my family and even complete strangers for financial help, but I've exhausted every other available option. I love Allie more than life itself. I will do anything humanly possible to help save her life. I’m her full time caretaker and while being self-employed has benefited my schedule, it has cut my income by almost 30% in the last year.  We have tried to get funding through insurance, charity groups, state Medicare and various cancer foundations, but Allie is in a catch 22 situation. For those of you who do not know her history, she really is a warrior! Three and a half years ago, when she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she was given 6 months to live and only a 30% chance of making it out of surgery. While her brain surgery went well, her chemo and radiation treatments almost killed her. The chemo completely blew out her autoimmune system.  Leaving Allie to suffer from Aplastic anemia, which is very rare with only about 800 cases diagnosed a year. She also has a rare form of leukemia, which means her blood cells don't mature. They call it M.D.S (myelodysplastic syndrome) which is causing her to be  neutropenic. Basically this all means that Allie needs a bone marrow transplant because her bone marrow will not produce red cells, white cells or platelets.Because Allie’s brain tumor is an Astrocytoma (aggressive stage three cancer), insurance will not even consider covering the bone marrow transplant until the cancer is in remission. The catch is that the cancer will not go into remission without her autoimmune system being healthy. Currently, Allie gets infusions of blood and platelets at least once, sometimes twice, a week.  The infusions are keeping her alive, but they do nothing to help her heal. She needs the bone marrow transfusion for that.All of her doctors agree that they can't fight the cancer, or the other adverse health effects, until the bone marrow transplant is completed successfully. They are saying that a bone marrow transplant is the only chance Allie has to beat the cancer into remission. The good news is that they found 3 donor matches. One is even here in Illinois. The bad news is that her transplant surgery will cost in excess of $350,000 dollars. And that’s just for the surgery.That doesn't include compensation to the donor, her organ transplant medication (estimated to be $5,000 each month), any extended hospital stays, follow up M.R.I's, other medications, tests and things we haven’t even thought of yet. They have told me the medical expenses would be in excess of $1,000,000 over the first 10 years.I realize it’s the worst time of year to be asking people for donations, but Allie's chances of beating this go down with every day, week and month that goes by.It would be easiest and least burdensome if a lot of people were able to give a small amount of money than it would be for a few people to give lot of money. So I was hoping I could appeal to your sense of competition and make this a game of sorts.If each of you were able to donate between $10 to $100 and then recruit just two friends to also donate $10 to $100, with the commit of getting two of their friends to do the same, we would have the money in no time. No one would have to give big money, but we could still save Allie's life. For such a small amount of money, you can feel good about yourself and you will have me forever grateful and in your debt. All the money collected will go directly to offset the cost of surgery and medical bills. If anyone has advice or ideas on how I can raise the money quicker or easier, please don’t be shy. I welcome all the ideas and any advice I can get. Whether you are able to donate to Allie's fight or not, I would like to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read this and to consider donating.Please help if you can.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/36l8wwo,Carol Nagy Newton&family fundraiser,"As most of you know my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer a few months ago. Since she found out she has gone through so much. She underwent surgery Dec 2nd to remove the cancer and we were told they were successful at removing it all. She had some complications and had to be transferred to London hospital as part of her lung collapsed and she needed a drainage tube put in. After she returned to Windsor she was getting much better and was able to come home to us finally. She was doing great and her breathing was good and her pain was under control but she still had the drainage tube in and needed a nurse to come every day to give her IV antibiotics. Thursday morning Dec 29th while the nurse was here she noticed blood in her tube and the nurse suggested that she go to the hospital to get checked out. They did a chest X-ray and CT scan and said everything looked good and that she was healing fine and sent her home. That evening she was feeling fine and watching a movie with my step dad Terry when all of a sudden she started to cough up blood. She yelled to me to come quickly as I did and when I got to her she was vomiting blood badly and was choking on it. She couldn't breath and I called 911. With the help of my neighbor , good friend, EMS and firefighters they were able to get her intabated. She suffered a heart attack along the way and her heart stopped and they had to revive her. She is now at Windsor Regional Hospital Ouellette campus in ICU. She is nowhere near out of the woods. The MRI shows she has a lot of brain damage from the lack of oxygen but the doctors want to wait a couple more days to see if she heals more and gets stronger then maybe she will start responding. Our family needs your help. This is so very hard for me to do and I would never ever ask for money but at this point in time I have no choice. My step dad Terry is still trying to work as we need the money but it isnt even close enough to pay for everything. My mom has been off work with no income and I have little to none myself as I myself am injuried and haven't been able to work. My step dad is a great man and is doing his best to provide for us but this has taken such a toll on him mentally and it's taking time away from being with my mom who needs him desperately right now. He has already taken many unpaid days off work since my mom has been sick.

Many people wonder how I ended up about 4,000 miles away from my home. Well, my country has been going through governmental corruption which has brought forth inequality for a very extended period of time and the problem never seems to cease. I am tired of seeing children who lack food or clothes, getting addicted to drugs and adjusting to a system of mediocrity and limitless pain and suffering. I am also tired of seeing my country’s authorities gain unjust wealth as a result of corruption by turning a blind eye to all these issues. As I grew up, I realized my country’s situation and I figured I could not keep living in a place where all these inequities went unnoticed, so I decided I wanted to study Political Science, so that someday, I will be able to do what my authorities have failed to do for a long time: create efficient and empathetic policies to generate equal opportunities for all the citizens regardless of their socio-economic status. Now, I am making my dream a reality. The Department of State of the United States awarded me with a scholarship called, “Opportunity Funds”, the scholarship covered my flight tickets to the university, as well as full coverage of standardized tests that I had to take in order to apply to different schools. Last year, I paid the remaining balance left on my tuition through raffles I organized, a scholarship from the Paraguayan-Kansas Committee, as well as other donations, and an offer from a professor to live at his place for my first year; which I feel very blessed and thankful about. For the second semester of my sophomore year, I am needing the quantity of USD 1,650 for my tuition and USD 482 for health insurance coverage. I will really appreciate your help no matter how much you can assist me with my educational journey.

He served in Korea from 1957-1958. He worked as a driver for the Chestnut Ridge Bus Company for 30 years and still currently works there as a monitor. He's well-known throughout the East Ramapo School District as he's driven for most of the schools. He is well-liked and respected by kids, parents, and school personell throughout the district. Kuch joined The Brewer Fire Engine Company #1 (""Monsey"") in 1953 and is the oldest active member of the company. He continues to frequent the firehouse daily, cleaning and ordering supplies, helping out in any way he can. He served as Captain of the Fire Police and is honored to have volunteered his last 63 years to serve with that company and continues to do so. We his family, in conjunction with the Monsey Fire Department, are launching this page/fund for Kuch in an effort to assist with the ongoing costs that are accumulating as a result of his recent diagnosis.

He doesn't take kindly to help of any kind, which is why his friends and family are reaching out here. We appreciate any donations of any amount to help lighten the financial burden due to the rising costs associated with his diagnosis.

Thank you so much for visiting this page and thinking of me.  A group of leaders from my church will be traveling to Israel in February 2017, and it's truly on my heart to join this trip. This is a two-fold mission. We will walk where Jesus walked, experiencing God intimately and encountering the Biblical world, from which the scriptures emerged. Also, we will meet and learn from Israeli and Palestinian people – from leaders to refugees, as we seek to understand the complexities of the current political, religious and humanitarian crisis in Israel. Our goal is to return as transformed individuals, with our hearts and eyes open to the tremendous grief, anger, fear and suffering felt by Israeli and Palestinian people.  We pray that this experience would help us to build bridges across lines of conflict and to be better advocates for peace and justice.  The trip will take place in partnership with local friends at National Community Church and Telos Group, a nonprofit organization that equips leaders to advocate for a pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, pro-peace solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Telos is building and equipping a network of church leaders who view peacemaking as a core component of Christian discipleship and are willing to be partners for peace in Israel/Palestine and beyond.In 2017, this will be my first step in a lifelong commitment to understanding, defending and promoting the peace and flourishing of all people, in the Middle East and the world. I am so thankful beyond words for this opportunity to serve God's people and to follow His call to be Peacemaker. How You Can Help With this trip comes great financial expenses -- To participate, the amount I'd need to fundraise is $3,800  by February 8th (ahh so soon!) I am hopeful that all funds can be raised by then. Your donation will help me to cover all travel expenses, which are roundtrip airfare and transportation between Washington, D.C. and Israel, meals, lodging and insurance for safety during the riskier parts of the trip. Any amount received is so appreciated. I am also so thankful for those who can support me in prayers for safety and wisdom during this trip, and for the dignity, security and freedom of the people in Israel.Thank you in advance for your prayers and financial support.

I have committed myself to riding in the 2017 Police Unity Tour. The Police Unity Tour is a group of incredibly dedicated people made up of Law Enforcement Officers and survivors of Law Enforcement Officers that have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. This group of people, in particular Chapter IX, make a yearly bicycle ride from Philadelphia, PA to Washington, D.C. The purpose of this ride is to raise public awareness of those officers whom have made the ultimate sacrifice. The secondary purpose of the Police Unity Tour is to raise the much needed funds for the upkeep and maintenance of the memorial, memorial grounds, and the soon to be opening National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Museum.Every 56 hours in the United States of America, a Law Enforcement Officer is killed in the line of duty. In 2016, 139 Law Enforcement Officers and over 35 Police K9's lost their lives.In my years as a Constable, I have been to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial many times. To see it and experience it from a spectators point of view is absolutely breathtaking. Unfortunately, in my years in law enforcement, I have also seen at least 8 people that I have known be added to that wall. Nothing, hits home as hard to a Law Enforcement Officer as seeing somebody's name that you have a personal connection to added to that wall. To see their survivors, whose lives have been shattered as their loved one has been taken way too soon, also staring at that wall, is heartbreaking. It reminds me how lucky I am, but it also reminds me to never forget them. Please help me make sure that each Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Son or Daughter will NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!Each rider is responsible for raising $1,750.00 to ride. This money goes to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and Museum. The rider does not keep any money. I am asking for your donation to help me meet the $1,750 that I am committed to raising. If there is anything that you can do to help me, it would be greatly appreciated! Every dollar helps!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/phast,PHAST Timing Board Fundraiser,"Hello PHAST Families and Extended Friends and Family. Many of us were blown away this past summer by the awesome timing board at Rancho San Miguel. This inspired a few us to look into the logistics of getting a similar timing board at our pool. The new timing board we would like to purchase will list the times by lanes 1-6 all at once . This new board would be wheeled out to the side of the pool and set up next to the announcer so that the swimmers can finish a race and immediately look over and see their time. We also plan to leave our original timing board on the roof of the pool house so parents and the away team can see times displayed there. All of this amazing technology comes at a cost that we are asking you all to help with. The cost for the new board and related equipment is approximately $7,500. We have already been able to raise around $1,800 from the the 2016 swim a thon.  We would like to be able to raise the funds needed to have this board in place by the start of the 2017 swim season. Many of you were excited to hear about the possibility of this happening last season.

In those 20 years he was blessed to get a kidney transplant in 1998, this kidney lasted him till roughly 2012.  At that time he went back on dialysis.  Since then he has had numerous cardiac issues, needing multiple cardiac procedures. He has over come so many hurdles, and fought so many battles to stay alive. November 26th 2016, he was sent home on a Intravenous Dopamine infusion and was told by the outstanding doctors at his favorite hospital Cedars-Siani, that there was ""nothing more they could do for him"". They encouraged him to go home and spend what ever remaining time he has left with his family. He decided to be placed on hospice on December 16th 2016.  This past week has been a struggle for him, he has even said ""its getting harder and harder to reach his goals"" and he realizes him dieing is ""going to happen"". His last days are very soon.  One of the things he has been worried about is how my mom, financially was going to be able to survive. They do not have life insurance.  Anyone who deals with a family member that has a chronic illness knows its next to impossible to get life insurance.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/cure-for-danons-disease,Cure for Danon Disease,"￼          My name is Joseph Schoedel I am 19 years old, and I'm from Long Island, NY. The reason why I'm creating this campaign today is that I want to raise awareness for finding a cure for Danon disease.                      My story on how I got Danon's disease.  As I was participating in gym class playing a basketball game. I felt a slight palpitation in my chest so I felt the need of having to go to the school nurse to get a  listen to my chest just to be cautious. The school nurse listened, and what she heard was described a heart murmur which is basically an abnormal heartbeat that sounds like a swishing sound.   So, it was recommended for me to get checked out at my regular pediatrician. My doctor took a listen. The same exact sound was spotted. From there I had to schedule an appointment with a pediatric cardiologist to get some tests done. These tests would indicate whether or not there was something going on with my heart.  Obviously, the results came up positive. The cardiologist diagnosed me with something called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. What this does to your heart is it makes it hard for the heart to pump blood efficiently through the bloodstream because of how thick the heart muscle is. Normally with this diagnosis, your heart is up to three times the size of a normal size heart. This also causes shortness of breath, chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythms. There was no cure for it and they still haven’t found one to this day. The alternative treatments that were available to me included an implantable pacemaker/defibrillator. Which would protect you from dangerous heart episodes from occurring. The second option for an alternative treatment would be a medication called beta blockers to slow down or regulate the heart rate.       The next step in my journey was, it was highly recommended that I had to get pacemaker/defibrillator. The surgery was done at the Long Island Jewish Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park. Dr. Andrew Blaufox was my pediatric electrophysiologist at the time. Dr. Blaufox was also the surgeon that performed the operation on me that implanted the device into my chest. It was very painful and energy draining going through the process of getting it done. After having that surgery I was hurting on one side of my body for about three weeks because the scar that was bandaged up had to heal which made me very sore and deal with a lot of pain. The pros and cons though of having this device. The pros you know you are protected and you will be safe. The cons is if your heart goes beyond a certain rate the device detects it and the pacemaker will automatically shock you instantly. What that feels like is basically is either a hard punch to the chest or if somebody kicks you with a soccer ball super hard. I’ve gotten shocked twice in the span of 5 min in my life. The reason why that happened was in 2016 I was participating in a school volleyball tournament. I wasn’t watching how competitive I was getting. It got to the point where the pacemaker was tricked by physical activity and the device thought there was dangerous heart rhythm activity happening. I did have to go to the emergency room that night but everything ended up okay at the end after my heart doctor told me it wasn’t a dangerous situation. Two years later, I was 17 years old. I switched from LIJH to one of the best hospitals in the United States, NYU Langone Medical Center in NYC. I was admitted into the Heart and Rhythm Center department that specifically focused on what I was diagnosed with, which was (HCM).  My doctor was named Steven Fowler. He discovered the second diagnosis that I was diagnosed called Danon disease. Danon Disease is a rare genetic condition that causes muscle weakness, heart disease, and learning problems. This disease was caused by genetic mutations which could be only inherited from the mother. Males with Danon's disease usually develop the condition earlier than females and are more severely affected. In most cases, you need a heart transplant because of how severe the disease especially with males. Normally the affected males, on average, live to age 19, while affected females live to an average age of 34.    The first step on how Dr. Fowler discovered Danon disease was he had to inject glucose into my veins that also had radiation in it. I had to be in a room by myself for this procedure because it was dangerous for other people to be around me with high radiation running through my body in the situation. What the radiation basically did was it would send out a signal to show where the glucose would end up.      The second part of finding out the diagnosis was putting me in an MRI machine to detect where the radiation was to detect the glucose whether it set in any of my muscles. The results came up positive at the end. Danon disease was very rare at the time and I was one out of 500 people that had it in the whole world. Since then it seems that there have been more cases of it being discovered from 15,000 people and on.   My disease affects me mentally and physically in my life to this day. I’m very limited being active daily because of how careful I have to be with my heart. This would mean so much to me if this campaign was successful. This is also not just for me it's for all the people around the world that have this life-threatening disease. All proceeds will go to organizations specializing in finding a cure for Danon disease. Also, it will go towards for families that are affected by Danon's disease that are in need of financing for travel to hospitals. I would be thankful if everybody donated and supported this awareness.If you would like to read more about this I provided a link down below:      https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/danon-disease/",https://images.gofundme.com/6k47jb1IdrFxW0Ew3gt1jAXeRoQ=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17151634_1556901465124165_r.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Joseph Schoedel is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$1,180 raised of $10,000 goal"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/yf-family-help-fund,Family Help Fund,"Dear family and friends, I am reaching out to you on the behalf of myself and our family to ask for your help in our time of need.  As many of you know, our lives were rocked by tragedy on October 25th of 2015 when Abby had her car accident and we lost an amazing young man and friend, Alex Mundt.  We have been slowly trying to recuperate (if that is even possible) and put the pieces back together.  We have been overwhelmed throughout this entire process by the love and support that our family, friends, local lacrosse community, and the Myers Park community have provided us.  For this reason, the following request seems unfair and is an incredibly difficulty thing for us to request, but are out of options.  Except for serving the remainder of her probation, Abby’s criminal legal battle is pretty much behind us.  But the civil battle remains with Alex’s family.  In an effort to avoid a civil lawsuit, we have settled with Alex’s family.  This obviously has placed a great financial burden upon us, and we have utilized money that we had been saving for years.   In addition to the legal fees from both the criminal and civil cases, we are also faced with medical bills from the accident, as well as Nick’s recent knee surgery.  The second portion of an established payment is due to Alex’s family in February.  The first payment was made in November.  We are establishing a Go Fund Me for this purpose.  We understand that the holidays are a financially stressful time of year for many, and thus it makes this an even harder request for us to make.  But every little bit will truly make a difference for us.  And if you feel you can not help financially, then we just ask that you will prayer that the Great Provider will see us through this tribulation as he has guided us through the last 14 months.   We have kept silent on the financial toll it has taken on our family until now when it has gotten beyond what we could ever hope to handle on our own.  We know that we can never repay any of you for your kindness, but hope you know that if you ever need anything from us that we will assist in any way in which we are able.  If you want to speak to either Kristen or myself directly, please feel free to do so.",https://images.gofundme.com/hLG6r3irvD-6gIpvqxdcA1t6ilY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17151894_fb_1483405454.7361_funds.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Joseph McGaha is organizing this fundraiser.,Other,"$5,248 raised of $75,000 goal"

The cancer has spread to her cervical spine and liver. The Monday after Thanksgiving, Julie had emergency surgery to stabilize four broken vertebrae in her neck. Julie has been in the hospital since that time recovering. The cancer is stage 4, so at this point her doctors are trying to manage her cancer and alleviate her pain. There are many people who have asked if there is anything they could do to help Julie. She has a great support system in her family, but there are medical bills which aren't covered by insurance. This is one way of helping Julie and her family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/andrzej-tkaczyks-medical-fund,Andrzej Tkaczyk's Medical Fund,"Hi, my name is Ewa Palen and I’m a dear friend of the Tkaczyk family. I wanted to begin a fund for Andrzej as his beautiful and humble family touched my heart. In August, Andrzej suffered severe injuries to his back after a work accident in Poland.  He was hit from the back by an excavator bucket. Currently, he is under intensive care and therapy in Krakow, Poland. Andrzej is paralyzed from the waist down but it is unknown at this time if this will be permanent.However, we see progress with continued rehabilitation which will continue until January. After this period, the family will take over the financial responsibility as the insurance will discontinue the coverage. This will be an extremely impossible task as Andrzej was the sole family provider.  As a result, I wanted to help this family raise money to cover the extensive medical bills. The Tkaczyk family has always been there for any of us in need and it will mean so much to be able to be there for them.Please pray for Andrzej and his family.   Donations will be used for any medical expenses during Andrzej's long road to recovery. His dream is to heal and be there for his two children and his wife. Thank you so much for your donation. Cześć, mam na imię Ewa Paleń i jestem drogim przyjacielem rodziny Tkaczyk. Chciałem zacząć fundacje dla Andrzeja i jego rodziny która dotknęła moje serce. W sierpniu, Andrzej doznał poważnych obrażeń kręgosłupa po wypadku w pracy w Polsce. Został uderzony z tyłu przez łyżką koparki.  Jest w trakcie intensywnej opieki medycznej i terapii w Krakowie. Andrzej jest sparaliżowany od pasa w dół, ale nie wiadomo w tej chwili, czy to będzie trwałe.Jednak widzimy postęp w ciągłej rehabilitacji, która potrwa do stycznia. Po tym okresie, rodzina przejmie odpowiedzialność finansową ponieważ pokrycie ubezpieczeniowe będzie wyczerpane. Będzie to niezwykle niemożliwe, gdyż Andrzej był jedyna osoba utrzymująca rodzinę. W związku z tym chciałam pomóc  rodzinie pokryć rachunki medyczne.Rodzina Tkaczyk zawsze była tam dla każdego z nas w potrzebie a wiec możemy być tam dla nich także.Módlcie się za Andrzeja i jego rodzinę. Donacje zostaną wykorzystane w celu pokrycia wszelkich kosztów podczas długiej drogi Andrzeja do wyzdrowienia. Jego marzeniem jest, aby wyzdrowieć i być tam dla swoich dwojga dzieci i żony. Dziękuję z całego serca za pomoc.",https://images.gofundme.com/2rrS7SIpW4tididEuH7IQDK1mpc=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17152008_1483406221.9521.jpg,[],0,"Created January 2, 2017",Eva Palen is organizing this fundraiser.,"Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,215 raised of $5,000 goal"
